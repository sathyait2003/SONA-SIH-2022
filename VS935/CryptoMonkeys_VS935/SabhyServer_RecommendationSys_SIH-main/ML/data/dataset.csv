KM3NeT sensitivity to low energy astrophysical neutrinos,"KM3NeT, a new generation of neutrino telescope, is currently being deployed
in the Mediterranean Sea. While its two sites, ORCA and ARCA, were respectively
designed for the determination of neutrino mass hierarchy and high-energy
neutrino astronomy, this contribution presents a study of the detection
potential of KM3NeT in the MeV-GeV energy range. At these low energies, the
data rate is dominated by low-energy atmospheric muons and environmental noise
due to bioluminescence and K-40 decay. The goal of this study is to
characterize the environmental noise in order to optimize the selection of
low-energy neutrino interactions and increase the sensitivity of KM3NeT to
transient astrophysical phenomena, such as close-by core-collapse Supernovae,
solar flares, and extragalactic transients. In this contribution, we will study
how using data science tools might improve the sensitivity of KM3NeT in these
low-energy neutrino searches. We will first introduce the data sets and the
different variables used to characterize KM3NeT's response to the environmental
noise. We will then compare the efficiency of various tools in identifying
different components in the environmental noise and in disentangling low-energy
neutrino interactions from the background events. We will conclude with the
implication of low-energy neutrinos for future astrophysical transient
searches.","neutrino,Sea,low-energy",Science
Dynamic Belief Fusion for Object Detection,"A novel approach for the fusion of detection scores from disparate object
detection methods is proposed. In order to effectively integrate the outputs of
multiple detectors, the level of ambiguity in each individual detection score
(called ""uncertainty"") is estimated using the precision/recall relationship of
the corresponding detector. The proposed fusion method, called Dynamic Belief
Fusion (DBF), dynamically assigns basic probabilities to propositions (target,
non-target, uncertain) based on confidence levels in the detection results of
individual approaches. A joint basic probability assignment, containing
information from all detectors, is determined using Dempster's combination
rule, and is easily reduced to a single fused detection score. Experiments on
ARL and PASCAL VOC 07 datasets demonstrate that the detection accuracy of DBF
is considerably greater than conventional fusion approaches as well as
state-of-the-art individual detectors.","detection,fusion,detectors",Science

Egocentric Object Manipulation Graphs,"We introduce Egocentric Object Manipulation Graphs (Ego-OMG) - a novel
representation for activity modeling and anticipation of near future actions
integrating three components: 1) semantic temporal structure of activities, 2)
short-term dynamics, and 3) representations for appearance. Semantic temporal
structure is modeled through a graph, embedded through a Graph Convolutional
Network, whose states model characteristics of and relations between hands and
objects. These state representations derive from all three levels of
abstraction, and span segments delimited by the making and breaking of
hand-object contact. Short-term dynamics are modeled in two ways: A) through 3D
convolutions, and B) through anticipating the spatiotemporal end points of hand
trajectories, where hands come into contact with objects. Appearance is modeled
through deep spatiotemporal features produced through existing methods. We note
that in Ego-OMG it is simple to swap these appearance features, and thus
Ego-OMG is complementary to most existing action anticipation methods. We
evaluate Ego-OMG on the EPIC Kitchens Action Anticipation Challenge. The
consistency of the egocentric perspective of EPIC Kitchens allows for the
utilization of the hand-centric cues upon which Ego-OMG relies. We demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, outranking all other previous published methods
by large margins and ranking first on the unseen test set and second on the
seen test set of the EPIC Kitchens Action Anticipation Challenge. We attribute
the success of Ego-OMG to the modeling of semantic structure captured over long
timespans. We evaluate the design choices made through several ablation
studies. Code will be released upon acceptance","graph,Manipulation,anticipation",Artificial Intelligence

Zero-Assignment Constraint for Graph Matching with Outliers,"Graph matching (GM), as a longstanding problem in computer vision and pattern
recognition, still suffers from numerous cluttered outliers in practical
applications. To address this issue, we present the zero-assignment constraint
(ZAC) for approaching the graph matching problem in the presence of outliers.
The underlying idea is to suppress the matchings of outliers by assigning
zero-valued vectors to the potential outliers in the obtained optimal
correspondence matrix. We provide elaborate theoretical analysis to the
problem, i.e., GM with ZAC, and figure out that the GM problem with and without
outliers are intrinsically different, which enables us to put forward a
sufficient condition to construct valid and reasonable objective function.
Consequently, we design an efficient outlier-robust algorithm to significantly
reduce the incorrect or redundant matchings caused by numerous outliers.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve the
state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency, especially in
the presence of numerous outliers.","outliers,problem,ZAC",Artificial Intelligence

"Natural Attenuation of Groundwater Contaminants: New Paradigms, Technologies, and Applications","Cleaning up the large number of groundwater contamination sites is a significant and complex environmental challenge. The environmental industry is continuously looking for remediation methods that are both effective and cost-efficient. Over the past 10 years there have been amazing, important developments in our understanding of key attenuation processes and technologies for evaluating natural attenuation processes, and a changing institutional perspective on when and where Monitored Natural Attenuation (MNA) may be applied. Despite these advances, restoring groundwater contaminated by anthropogenic sources to allow for unrestricted use continues to be a challenge. Because of a complex mix of physical, chemical, and biological constraints associated with active in-situ cleanup technologies, there has been a long standing focus on understanding natural processes that attenuate groundwater contaminant plumes. We will build upon basic environmental science and environmental engineering principles to discover how to best implement MNA as a viable treatment for groundwater contamination plumes. Additionally we will delve into the history behind and make predictions about the new directions for this technology. Any professional working in the environmental remediation industry will benefit from this in-depth study of MNA. We will use lectures, readings, and computational exercises to enhance our understanding and implementation of MNA. At the completion of this course, students will have updated understanding and practical tools that can be applied to all possible MNA sites.","MNA,environmental,attenuation",Technology

Evidence-based Toxicology,"Welcome to the Evidence-based Toxicology (EBT) course. In medicine and healthcare, evidence-based medicine has revolutionized the way that information is evaluated transparently and objectively. Over the past ten years, a movement in North America and Europe has attempted to translate this revolution to the field of toxicology. The Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing (CAAT) within the department of Environmental Health and Engineering at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health hosts the first chair for EBT and the secretariat for the EBT Collaboration on both sides of the Atlantic. Based on the Cochrane Collaboration in Evidence-based Medicine, the EBT Collaboration was established at the CAAT to foster the development of a process for quality assurance of new toxicity tests for the assessment of safety in humans and the environment. Regulatory safety sciences have undergone remarkably little change in the past fifty years. At the same time, our knowledge in the life sciences is doubling about every seven years. Systematic review and related evidence-based approaches are beginning to be adapted by regulatory agencies like the Environment Protection Agency (EPA), the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), and the US National Toxicology Program. They provide transparent, objective, and consistent tools to identify, select, appraise, and extract evidence across studies. This course will showcase these emerging efforts and address opportunities and challenges to the expanded use of these tools within toxicology.","EBT,Evidence-based,Toxicology",Science

Attentive and Contrastive Learning for Joint Depth and Motion Field Estimation,"Estimating the motion of the camera together with the 3D structure of the
scene from a monocular vision system is a complex task that often relies on the
so-called scene rigidity assumption. When observing a dynamic environment, this
assumption is violated which leads to an ambiguity between the ego-motion of
the camera and the motion of the objects. To solve this problem, we present a
self-supervised learning framework for 3D object motion field estimation from
monocular videos. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we propose a two-stage
projection pipeline to explicitly disentangle the camera ego-motion and the
object motions with dynamics attention module, called DAM. Specifically, we
design an integrated motion model that estimates the motion of the camera and
object in the first and second warping stages, respectively, controlled by the
attention module through a shared motion encoder. Second, we propose an object
motion field estimation through contrastive sample consensus, called CSAC,
taking advantage of weak semantic prior (bounding box from an object detector)
and geometric constraints (each object respects the rigid body motion model).
Experiments on KITTI, Cityscapes, and Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate the
relevance of our approach and show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
algorithms for the tasks of self-supervised monocular depth estimation, object
motion segmentation, monocular scene flow estimation, and visual odometry.","motion,object,camera",Technology

Semantic-aware Knowledge Distillation for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning,"Few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL) portrays the problem of learning
new concepts gradually, where only a few examples per concept are available to
the learner. Due to the limited number of examples for training, the techniques
developed for standard incremental learning cannot be applied verbatim to
FSCIL. In this work, we introduce a distillation algorithm to address the
problem of FSCIL and propose to make use of semantic information during
training. To this end, we make use of word embeddings as semantic information
which is cheap to obtain and which facilitate the distillation process.
Furthermore, we propose a method based on an attention mechanism on multiple
parallel embeddings of visual data to align visual and semantic vectors, which
reduces issues related to catastrophic forgetting. Via experiments on
MiniImageNet, CUB200, and CIFAR100 dataset, we establish new state-of-the-art
results by outperforming existing approaches.","learning,FSCIL,incremental",Deep Learning
Transformer in Transformer,"Transformer is a new kind of neural architecture which encodes the input data
as powerful features via the attention mechanism. Basically, the visual
transformers first divide the input images into several local patches and then
calculate both representations and their relationship. Since natural images are
of high complexity with abundant detail and color information, the granularity
of the patch dividing is not fine enough for excavating features of objects in
different scales and locations. In this paper, we point out that the attention
inside these local patches are also essential for building visual transformers
with high performance and we explore a new architecture, namely, Transformer iN
Transformer (TNT). Specifically, we regard the local patches (e.g.,
16$\times$16) as ""visual sentences"" and present to further divide them into
smaller patches (e.g., 4$\times$4) as ""visual words"". The attention of each
word will be calculated with other words in the given visual sentence with
negligible computational costs. Features of both words and sentences will be
aggregated to enhance the representation ability. Experiments on several
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TNT architecture,
e.g., we achieve an $81.5%$ top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet, which is about
$1.7%$ higher than that of the state-of-the-art visual transformer with similar
computational cost. The PyTorch code is available at

Background Learnable Cascade for Zero-Shot Object Detection,"Zero-shot detection (ZSD) is crucial to large-scale object detection with the
aim of simultaneously localizing and recognizing unseen objects. There remain
several challenges for ZSD, including reducing the ambiguity between background

semantic of ZSD; (ii) we develop the semantic information flow structure and
directly add it between each stage in Cascade Semantic RCNN to further improve

Truncated Emphatic Temporal Difference Methods for Prediction and Control,"Emphatic Temporal Difference (TD) methods are a class of off-policy
Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods involving the use of followon traces.
Despite the theoretical success of emphatic TD methods in addressing the
notorious deadly triad (Sutton and Barto, 2018) of off-policy RL, there are
still three open problems. First, the motivation for emphatic TD methods
proposed by Sutton et al. (2016) does not align with the convergence analysis
of Yu (2015). Namely, a quantity used by Sutton et al. (2016) that is expected
to be essential for the convergence of emphatic TD methods is not used in the
actual convergence analysis of Yu (2015). Second, followon traces typically
suffer from large variance, making them hard to use in practice. Third, despite
the seminal work of Yu (2015) confirming the asymptotic convergence of some
emphatic TD methods for prediction problems, there is still no finite sample
analysis for any emphatic TD method for prediction, much less control. In this
paper, we address those three open problems simultaneously via using truncated
followon traces in emphatic TD methods. Unlike the original followon traces,
which depend on all previous history, truncated followon traces depend on only
finite history, reducing variance and enabling the finite sample analysis of
our proposed emphatic TD methods for both prediction and control.","methods,Emphatic,Difference",Artificial Intelligence
Data-Free Point Cloud Network for 3D Face Recognition,"Point clouds-based Networks have achieved great attention in 3D object
classification, segmentation and indoor scene semantic parsing. In terms of
face recognition, 3D face recognition method which directly consume point
clouds as input is still under study. Two main factors account for this: One is
how to get discriminative face representations from 3D point clouds using deep
network; the other is the lack of large 3D training dataset. To address these
problems, a data-free 3D face recognition method is proposed only using
synthesized unreal data from statistical 3D Morphable Model to train a deep
point cloud network. To ease the inconsistent distribution between model data
and real faces, different point sampling methods are used in train and test
phase. In this paper, we propose a curvature-aware point sampling(CPS) strategy
replacing the original furthest point sampling(FPS) to hierarchically
down-sample feature-sensitive points which are crucial to pass and aggregate
features deeply. A PointNet++ like Network is used to extract face features
directly from point clouds. The experimental results show that the network
trained on generated data generalizes well for real 3D faces. Fine tuning on a
small part of FRGCv2.0 and Bosphorus, which include real faces in different
poses and expressions, further improves recognition accuracy.","Point,face,network",Deep Learning

A Hybrid Stochastic Policy Gradient Algorithm for Reinforcement Learning,"We propose a novel hybrid stochastic policy gradient estimator by combining
an unbiased policy gradient estimator, the REINFORCE estimator, with another
biased one, an adapted SARAH estimator for policy optimization. The hybrid
policy gradient estimator is shown to be biased, but has variance reduced
property. Using this estimator, we develop a new Proximal Hybrid Stochastic
Policy Gradient Algorithm (ProxHSPGA) to solve a composite policy optimization
problem that allows us to handle constraints or regularizers on the policy
parameters. We first propose a single-looped algorithm then introduce a more
practical restarting variant. We prove that both algorithms can achieve the
best-known trajectory complexity $\mathcal{O}\left(\varepsilon^{-3}\right)$ to
attain a first-order stationary point for the composite problem which is better
than existing REINFORCE/GPOMDP $\mathcal{O}\left(\varepsilon^{-4}\right)$ and
SVRPG $\mathcal{O}\left(\varepsilon^{-10/3}\right)$ in the non-composite
setting. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm on several well-known
examples in reinforcement learning. Numerical results show that our algorithm
outperforms two existing methods on these examples. Moreover, the composite
settings indeed have some advantages compared to the non-composite ones on
certain problems.","policy,gradient,estimator",Artificial Intelligence
Inference in epidemiological agent-based models using ensemble-based data assimilation,"To represent the complex individual interactions in the dynamics of disease
spread informed by data, the coupling of an epidemiological agent-based model
with the ensemble Kalman filter is proposed. The statistical inference of the
propagation of a disease by means of ensemble-based data assimilation systems
has been studied in previous work. The models used are mostly compartmental
models representing the mean field evolution through ordinary differential
equations. These techniques allow to monitor the propagation of the infections
from data and to estimate several parameters of epidemiological interest.
However, there are many important features which are based on the individual
interactions that cannot be represented in the mean field equations, such as
social network and bubbles, contact tracing, isolating individuals in risk, and
social network-based distancing strategies. Agent-based models can describe
contact networks at an individual level, including demographic attributes such
as age, neighbourhood, household, workplaces, schools, entertainment places,
among others. Nevertheless, these models have several unknown parameters which
are thus difficult to estimate. In this work, we propose the use of
ensemble-based data assimilation techniques to calibrate an agent-based model
using daily epidemiological data. This raises the challenge of having to adapt
the agent populations to incorporate the information provided by the
coarse-grained data. To do this, two stochastic strategies to correct the model
predictions are developed. The ensemble Kalman filter with perturbed
observations is used for the joint estimation of the state and some key
epidemiological parameters. We conduct experiments with an agent based-model
designed for COVID-19 and assess the proposed methodology on synthetic data and
on COVID-19 daily reports from Ciudad Aut\'onoma de Buenos Aires, Argentina.","data,models,epidemiological",Machine Learning
Understanding Financial Statements: Company Position,"This course is designed to provide a basic understanding of financial statements with an emphasis on the balance sheet. However, to understand accounting driven financial statements, it is important to recognize that accounting is less about counting and more about measuring. �What is it that is being measured?� Well, as the course unfolds, you will learn about the three measurement questions and how the balance sheet helps to answer the first two of these questions. By touring a real company and interviewing real business people, the course describes the basic content of financial statements in a simple yet relevant context. The goal of the course is to leave a lasting impression about what balance sheet consists of and what it reveals. The next course in the Fundamentals of Accounting Specialization completes the conversation by addressing the remaining measurement question.

Delving into Robust Object Detection from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles: A Deep Nuisance Disentanglement Approach,"Object detection from images captured by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is
becoming increasingly useful. Despite the great success of the generic object
detection methods trained on ground-to-ground images, a huge performance drop
is observed when they are directly applied to images captured by UAVs. The
unsatisfactory performance is owing to many UAV-specific nuisances, such as
varying flying altitudes, adverse weather conditions, dynamically changing
viewing angles, etc. Those nuisances constitute a large number of fine-grained
domains, across which the detection model has to stay robust. Fortunately, UAVs
will record meta-data that depict those varying attributes, which are either
freely available along with the UAV images, or can be easily obtained. We
propose to utilize those free meta-data in conjunction with associated UAV
images to learn domain-robust features via an adversarial training framework
dubbed Nuisance Disentangled Feature Transform (NDFT), for the specific
challenging problem of object detection in UAV images, achieving a substantial
gain in robustness to those nuisances. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our

Semantics for Variational Quantum Programming,"We consider a programming language that can manipulate both classical and
quantum information. Our language is type-safe and designed for variational
quantum programming, which is a hybrid classical-quantum computational
paradigm. The classical subsystem of the language is the Probabilistic FixPoint
Calculus (PFPC), which is a lambda calculus with mixed-variance recursive
types, term recursion and probabilistic choice. The quantum subsystem is a
first-order linear type system that can manipulate quantum information. The two
subsystems are related by mixed classical/quantum terms that specify how
classical probabilistic effects are induced by quantum measurements, and
conversely, how classical (probabilistic) programs can influence the quantum
dynamics. We also describe a sound and computationally adequate denotational
semantics for the language. Classical probabilistic effects are interpreted
using a recently-described commutative probabilistic monad on DCPO. Quantum
effects and resources are interpreted in a category of von Neumann algebras
that we show is enriched over (continuous) domains. This strong sense of
enrichment allows us to develop novel semantic methods that we use to interpret
the relationship between the quantum and classical probabilistic effects. By
doing so we provide the first denotational analysis that relates models of
classical probabilistic programming to models of quantum programming.","quantum,Probabilistic,classical",Others
Multi-curvature viscous streaming: flow topology and particle manipulation,"Viscous streaming refers to the rectified, steady flows that emerge when a
liquid oscillates around an immersed microfeature, typically a solid body or a
bubble. The ability of such features to locally concentrate stresses produces
strong inertial effects to which both fluid and immersed particles respond
within short length (O(100) microns) and time (milliseconds) scales, rendering
viscous streaming arguably the most efficient mechanism to exploit inertia at
the microscale. Despite this potential, viscous streaming has been investigated
in rather narrow conditions, mostly making use of bodies of uniform curvature
(cylinders, spheres) for which induced flow topologies are constrained to only
two regimes, classically referred to as single and double layer regimes. This
severely limits the scope of potential applications, and sits in stark contrast
to inertial focusing (the approach that perhaps has most defined the field of
inertial microfluidics), where instead boundaries with multiple curvatures have
long been utilised to magnify inertial effects, expand design space, and enable
novel applications. Here, we demonstrate that a multi-curvature approach in
viscous streaming dramatically extends the range of accessible flow topologies.
We show that numerically predicted, but never experimentally observed,
streaming flows can be physically reproduced, computationally engineered, and
in turn used to enhance particle manipulation, filtering and separation in
compact, robust, tunable and inexpensive devices. Overall, this study provides
an avenue to unlock the utility of viscous streaming with potential
applications in manufacturing, environment, health and medicine, from particle
self-assembly to microplastics removal.","streaming,Viscous,inertial",Science

Unethical Decision Making in Organizations,"This course 'Unethical decision making in organizations : A seminar on the dark side of the force' will teach you how strong organizational contexts push good people towards unethical decisions. You will also learn how to protect yourself and your organization against such forces lurking in the dark. About the Course This course teaches how narrow frames and strong contexts can push good people towards unethical decisions and how they can protect themselves and their organization against ethical blindness. The goal of this course is to empower the participants to analyze the risks of unethical or illegal behavior that might be triggered by powerful contexts. It draws from various disciplines such as management, psychology, sociology, philosophy, and literature, in order to learn what these disciplines contribute to a better understanding of unethical behavior. The course also analyzes some of the most prominent organizational scandals of the recent decades through the lenses of these disciplines. Whenever we hear about ethical scandals, we tend to believe that unethical or illegal behaviour in organizations is driven by character deficiencies of individual actors. Put differently, we simply assume that bad things are done by bad people. However, numerous corporate scandals have demonstrated that even people with a high level of integrity can break the rules if they are put into a strong context. A better understanding of why and under what conditions good people make bad ethical decisions will enable us to better protect individuals as well as their respective organizations against the potentially overwhelming power of the context. It will also enable us to cure societies from problems like corruption. At the end of the course, you are able to: 1. Explain the impact of social context on individual decision making using various theories (from Management, Sociology, Psychology, and Philosophy) 2. Apply these theories to the analysis of some of the most eminent organizational scandals of the recent decades 3. Assess risks of ethical blindness in your own organizational context 4. Design interventions to reduce such risks for yourself and your organization Recommended Background No background expertise is required. The course is open for interested layperson as well as experts who work on related topics, be it as researchers or practitioners (e.g., compliance managers in corporations). Why is this course important for me? Currently, the understanding of why good people make unethical decisions is rather limited, related research is rather fragmented, and the management of such problems in organizations is overly simplistic, legalistic, and inadequate. Understanding contexts, including the dangers of routines, the mindlessness of our daily decisions, and the healing power of mindful decision-making routines is of increasing importance. In this course, you will learn the latest knowledge and the appropriate tool box for dealing with ethical challenges that you will face throughout your life! What do I need to follow this course? We build bridges between various scientific disciplines and will familiarize you with those disciplines smoothly. You need no expertise, just come and share your own real-world experiences about unethical decisions. After all, we are all experts in making decisions�some more ethically, some less ethically�aren�t we?","Unethical,decisions,people",Ethics

"CRANE: a 10 Degree-of-Freedom, Tele-surgical System for Dexterous Manipulation within Imaging Bores","Physicians perform minimally invasive percutaneous procedures under Computed
Tomography (CT) image guidance both for the diagnosis and treatment of numerous
diseases. For these procedures performed within Computed Tomography Scanners,
robots can enable physicians to more accurately target sub-dermal lesions while
increasing safety. However, existing robots for this application have limited
dexterity, workspace, or accuracy. This paper describes the design,
manufacture, and performance of a highly dexterous, low-profile, 8+2
Degree-ofFreedom (DoF) robotic arm for CT guided percutaneous needle biopsy. In
this article, we propose CRANE: CT Robot and Needle Emplacer. The design
focuses on system dexterity with high accuracy: extending physicians' ability
to manipulate and insert needles within the scanner bore while providing the
high accuracy possible with a robot. We also propose and validate a system
architecture and control scheme for low profile and highly accurate
image-guided robotics, that meets the clinical requirements for target accuracy
during an in-situ evaluation. The accuracy is additionally evaluated through a
trajectory tracking evaluation resulting in <0.2mm and <0.71degree tracking

Convolutional Neural Networks over Tree Structures for Programming Language Processing,"Programming language processing (similar to natural language processing) is a
hot research topic in the field of software engineering; it has also aroused
growing interest in the artificial intelligence community. However, different
from a natural language sentence, a program contains rich, explicit, and
complicated structural information. Hence, traditional NLP models may be
inappropriate for programs. In this paper, we propose a novel tree-based
convolutional neural network (TBCNN) for programming language processing, in
which a convolution kernel is designed over programs' abstract syntax trees to
capture structural information. TBCNN is a generic architecture for programming
language processing; our experiments show its effectiveness in two different
program analysis tasks: classifying programs according to functionality, and
detecting code snippets of certain patterns. TBCNN outperforms baseline
methods, including several neural models for NLP.","language,processing,TBCNN",Artificial Intelligence

Large Margin Mechanism and Pseudo Query Set on Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning,"In recent years, few-shot learning problems have received a lot of attention.
While methods in most previous works were trained and tested on datasets in one
single domain, cross-domain few-shot learning is a brand-new branch of few-shot
learning problems, where models handle datasets in different domains between
training and testing phases. In this paper, to solve the problem that the model
is pre-trained (meta-trained) on a single dataset while fine-tuned on datasets
in four different domains, including common objects, satellite images, and
medical images, we propose a novel large margin fine-tuning method (LMM-PQS),
which generates pseudo query images from support images and fine-tunes the
feature extraction modules with a large margin mechanism inspired by methods in
face recognition. According to the experiment results, LMM-PQS surpasses the
baseline models by a significant margin and demonstrates that our approach is
robust and can easily adapt pre-trained models to new domains with few data.","learning,few-shot,datasets",Artificial Intelligence

Scale-constrained Unsupervised Evaluation Method for Multi-scale Image Segmentation,"Unsupervised evaluation of segmentation quality is a crucial step in image
segmentation applications. Previous unsupervised evaluation methods usually
lacked the adaptability to multi-scale segmentation. A scale-constrained
evaluation method that evaluates segmentation quality according to the
specified target scale is proposed in this paper. First, regional saliency and
merging cost are employed to describe intra-region homogeneity and inter-region
heterogeneity, respectively. Subsequently, both of them are standardized into
equivalent spectral distances of a predefined region. Finally, by analyzing the
relationship between image characteristics and segmentation quality, we
establish the evaluation model. Experimental results show that the proposed
method outperforms four commonly used unsupervised methods in multi-scale
evaluation tasks.","segmentation,evaluation,Unsupervised",Deep Learning

Measurement-induced phase transitions in sparse nonlocal scramblers,"Measurement-induced phase transitions arise due to a competition between the
scrambling of quantum information in a many-body system and local measurements.
In this work we investigate these transitions in different classes of fast
scramblers, systems that scramble quantum information as quickly as is
conjectured to be possible -- on a timescale proportional to the logarithm of
the system size. In particular, we consider sets of deterministic sparse
couplings that naturally interpolate between local circuits that slowly
scramble information and highly nonlocal circuits that achieve the
fast-scrambling limit. We find that circuits featuring sparse nonlocal
interactions are able to withstand substantially higher rates of local
measurement than circuits with only local interactions, even at comparable gate
depths. We also study the quantum error-correcting codes that support the
volume-law entangled phase and find that our maximally nonlocal circuits yield
codes with nearly extensive contiguous code distance. Use of these sparse,
deterministic circuits opens pathways towards the design of noise-resilient
quantum circuits and error correcting codes in current and future quantum
devices with minimum gate numbers.","circuits,quantum,local",Science
Magnetic field induced Valley-Polarized Quantum Anomalous Hall Effects in Ferromagnetic van der Waals Heterostructures,"The valley-polarized quantum anomalous Hall effect (VQAHE) attracts intensive
interest since it uniquely combines valleytronics and spintronics with
nontrivial band topology. Here, based on first-principles calculations and
Wannier-function-based tight-binding (WFTB) model, we reveal that valley-based
Hall effects and especially the VQAHE induced by external magnetic fields can
occur in two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic van der Waals heterostructures
(vdWHs). The results show that considerable valley-splitting derived from the
Zeeman exchange energy drives these vdWHs generating the valley anomalous Hall
effect and then the VQAHE. The chiral edge states and quantized Hall
conductance are utilized to confirm the presence of VQAHE. Besides, it is also
found that external electric fields (or tuning interlayer distances) can
facilitate the realization of VQAHE, and thus we present a phase diagram in a
broad parameter regime of magnetic fields and electric fields (or interlayer
distances). Our work not only offers a class of ferromagnetic vdWHs to realize
various valley-based Hall phases, but also can guide advancements for designing
topological devices with spin-valley filtering effects based on the VQAHE.","VQAHE,Hall,fields",Science
"Life, the universe and the hidden meaning of everything","It is hard to look at the universe and not wonder about the meaning, of,
well, everything. A natural question is whether what we see is a sign of
intelligent design. The antithesis of design would be a random universe or,
assuming laws of physics, one whose fundamental physical parameters were
randomly selected, but conditioned on life (ourselves) being here to observe
it. In unpublished work, the British physicist Dennis Sciama argued that such a
randomly selected universe would display a statistical signature. He concluded
that a random universe would almost certainly have parameters only just
allowing for the possibility of life. Here we consider whether this signature
is definitive. We find that with plausible additional assumptions Sciama's
signature would appear to reverse: Were our universe random, it could give the
false impression of being intelligently designed, with the fundamental
constants appearing to be fine-tuned to a strong probability for life to emerge
and be maintained.","universe,random,meaning",Science

Beyond Low-pass Filtering: Graph Convolutional Networks with Automatic Filtering,"Graph convolutional networks are becoming indispensable for deep learning
from graph-structured data. Most of the existing graph convolutional networks
share two big shortcomings. First, they are essentially low-pass filters, thus
the potentially useful middle and high frequency band of graph signals are
ignored. Second, the bandwidth of existing graph convolutional filters is
fixed. Parameters of a graph convolutional filter only transform the graph
inputs without changing the curvature of a graph convolutional filter function.
In reality, we are uncertain about whether we should retain or cut off the
frequency at a certain point unless we have expert domain knowledge. In this
paper, we propose Automatic Graph Convolutional Networks (AutoGCN) to capture
the full spectrum of graph signals and automatically update the bandwidth of
graph convolutional filters. While it is based on graph spectral theory, our
AutoGCN is also localized in space and has a spatial form. Experimental results
show that AutoGCN achieves significant improvement over baseline methods which
only work as low-pass filters.","Graph,convolutional,networks",Deep Learning

Compositional Construction of Abstractions for Infinite Networks of Switched Systems,"We construct compositional continuous approximations for an interconnection
of infinitely many discrete-time switched systems. An approximation (known as
abstraction) is itself a continuous-space system, which can be used as a
replacement of the original (known as concrete) system in a controller design
process. Having synthesized a controller for the abstract system, the
controller is refined to a more detailed controller for the concrete system. To
quantify the mismatch between the output trajectory of the approximation and of
that the original system, we use the notion of so-called simulation functions.
In particular, each subsystem in the concrete network and its corresponding one
in the abstract network is related through a local simulation function. We show
that if the local simulation functions satisfy a certain small-gain type
condition developed for a network of infinitely many subsystems, then the
aggregation of the individual simulation functions provides an overall
simulation function between the overall abstraction and the concrete network.
For a network of linear switched systems, we systematically construct local
abstractions and local simulation functions, where the required conditions are
expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities and can be efficiently
computed. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach through an
application to frequency control in a power gird with a switched (i.e.

normal refinement of transparent shapes and a feature mapping based on
predicted normals for 3D point cloud reconstruction. We render a synthetic

Ethical Leadership Through Giving Voice to Values,"This course offers an action-oriented introduction to Giving Voice to Values (or GVV), an exciting new approach to values-driven leadership development in the workplace, in business education and in life. GVV is not about persuading people to be more ethical, but instead it starts from the premise that most of us already want to act on our values, but that we also want to feel that we have a reasonable chance of doing so effectively. Through positive, real life examples, pre-scripting, rehearsal and peer coaching, GVV builds the skill, the confidence and likelihood that we will act on our values more often and more successfully. Based on research and practice, with over 1,000 pilots in educational settings and companies on all seven continents, GVV helps answer the questions: �What if I were going to act on my values? What would I say and do? How could I be most effective?� This course was developed at the Darden School of Business at the University of Virginia and is taught by top-ranked faculty. You will come away from GVV with an expanded toolkit, as well as practice, in a variety of methods and techniques for voicing and enacting your own values and principles. You will develop and practice leadership skills in ""peer coaching� with other learners. Through cases and stories based on recognizable workplace, classroom and life values conflicts, you will apply the GVV techniques and �re-frames�, expanding your repertoire for possible action as well as identifying and rehearsing responses that are likely to be most effective.

Joint Delay and Phase Precoding Under True-Time Delay Constraint for THz Massive MIMO,"A new approach is presented to the problem of compensating the beam squint

constraints. Unlike the prior approaches, the new approach does not require the
unbounded time delay assumption; the range of time delay values that a TTD
device can produce is strictly limited in our approach. Instead of focusing on
the design of TTD values, we jointly optimize both the TTD and PS values to
effectively cope with the practical time delay constraint. Simulation results
that illustrate the performance benefits of the new method for the beam squint
compensation are presented. Through simulations and analysis, we show that our
approach is a generalization of the prior TTD-based precoding approaches.","TTD,delay,approach",Technology

Deep DA for Ordinal Regression of Pain Intensity Estimation Using Weakly-Labeled Videos,"Automatic estimation of pain intensity from facial expressions in videos has
an immense potential in health care applications. However, domain adaptation
(DA) is needed to alleviate the problem of domain shifts that typically occurs
between video data captured in source and target do-mains. Given the laborious
task of collecting and annotating videos, and the subjective bias due to
ambiguity among adjacent intensity levels, weakly-supervised learning (WSL)is
gaining attention in such applications. Yet, most state-of-the-art WSL models
are typically formulated as regression problems, and do not leverage the
ordinal relation between intensity levels, nor the temporal coherence of
multiple consecutive frames. This paper introduces a new deep learn-ing model
for weakly-supervised DA with ordinal regression(WSDA-OR), where videos in
target domain have coarse la-bels provided on a periodic basis. The WSDA-OR
model enforces ordinal relationships among the intensity levels as-signed to
the target sequences, and associates multiple relevant frames to sequence-level
labels (instead of a single frame). In particular, it learns discriminant and
domain-invariant feature representations by integrating multiple in-stance
learning with deep adversarial DA, where soft Gaussian labels are used to
efficiently represent the weak ordinal sequence-level labels from the target
domain. The proposed approach was validated on the RECOLA video dataset as
fully-labeled source domain, and UNBC-McMaster video data as weakly-labeled
target domain. We have also validated WSDA-OR on BIOVID and Fatigue (private)

Deep Learning for Flight Demand and Delays Forecasting,"The last few years have seen an increased interest in deep learning (DL) due
to its success in applications such as computer vision, natural language
processing (NLP), and self-driving cars. Inspired by this success, this paper
applied DL to predict flight demand and delays, which have been a concern for
airlines and the other stakeholders in the National Airspace System (NAS).
Demand and delay prediction can be formulated as a supervised learning problem,
where, given an understanding of past historical demand and delays, a deep
learning network can examine sequences of historic data to predict current and
future sequences. With that in mind, we applied a well-known DL method,
sequence to sequence (seq2seq), to solve the problem. Our results show that the
seq2seq method can reduce demand prediction mean squared error (MSE) by 50%,
compared to two classical baseline algorithms.","NLP,demand,learning",Machine Learning

Geometric deep learning on graphs and manifolds using mixture model CNNs,"Deep learning has achieved a remarkable performance breakthrough in several
fields, most notably in speech recognition, natural language processing, and
computer vision. In particular, convolutional neural network (CNN)
architectures currently produce state-of-the-art performance on a variety of
image analysis tasks such as object detection and recognition. Most of deep
learning research has so far focused on dealing with 1D, 2D, or 3D
Euclidean-structured data such as acoustic signals, images, or videos.
Recently, there has been an increasing interest in geometric deep learning,
attempting to generalize deep learning methods to non-Euclidean structured data
such as graphs and manifolds, with a variety of applications from the domains
of network analysis, computational social science, or computer graphics. In
this paper, we propose a unified framework allowing to generalize CNN
architectures to non-Euclidean domains (graphs and manifolds) and learn local,
stationary, and compositional task-specific features. We show that various
non-Euclidean CNN methods previously proposed in the literature can be
considered as particular instances of our framework. We test the proposed
method on standard tasks from the realms of image-, graph- and 3D shape
analysis and show that it consistently outperforms previous approaches.","Deep,learning,CNN",Deep Learning
Low-Rank Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Multi-Task Learning,"In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task learning method based on the
deep convolutional network. The proposed deep network has four convolutional
layers, three max-pooling layers, and two parallel fully connected layers. To
adjust the deep network to multi-task learning problem, we propose to learn a
low-rank deep network so that the relation among different tasks can be
explored. We proposed to minimize the number of independent parameter rows of
one fully connected layer to explore the relations among different tasks, which
is measured by the nuclear norm of the parameter of one fully connected layer,
and seek a low-rank parameter matrix. Meanwhile, we also propose to regularize
another fully connected layer by sparsity penalty, so that the useful features
learned by the lower layers can be selected. The learning problem is solved by
an iterative algorithm based on gradient descent and back-propagation
algorithms. The proposed algorithm is evaluated over benchmark data sets of
multiple face attribute prediction, multi-task natural language processing, and
joint economics index predictions. The evaluation results show the advantage of
the low-rank deep CNN model over multi-task problems.","deep,network,connected",Deep Learning

Tuneable homogeneous kG magnetic field production using permanent magnets,"We present a permanent magnet arrangement that can achieve a tuneable axial
magnetic field from 1.80(8)-2.67(2) kG along the z-axis, where (x,y) = (0,0),

DAE-GAN: Dynamic Aspect-aware GAN for Text-to-Image Synthesis,"Text-to-image synthesis refers to generating an image from a given text
description, the key goal of which lies in photo realism and semantic
consistency. Previous methods usually generate an initial image with sentence
embedding and then refine it with fine-grained word embedding. Despite the
significant progress, the 'aspect' information (e.g., red eyes) contained in
the text, referring to several words rather than a word that depicts 'a
particular part or feature of something', is often ignored, which is highly
helpful for synthesizing image details. How to make better utilization of
aspect information in text-to-image synthesis still remains an unresolved
challenge. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a Dynamic
Aspect-awarE GAN (DAE-GAN) that represents text information comprehensively
from multiple granularities, including sentence-level, word-level, and
aspect-level. Moreover, inspired by human learning behaviors, we develop a
novel Aspect-aware Dynamic Re-drawer (ADR) for image refinement, in which an
Attended Global Refinement (AGR) module and an Aspect-aware Local Refinement
(ALR) module are alternately employed. AGR utilizes word-level embedding to
globally enhance the previously generated image, while ALR dynamically employs
aspect-level embedding to refine image details from a local perspective.
Finally, a corresponding matching loss function is designed to ensure the
text-image semantic consistency at different levels. Extensive experiments on
two well-studied and publicly available datasets (i.e., CUB-200 and COCO)
demonstrate the superiority and rationality of our method.","image,refinement,embedding",Deep Learning

Near Real-time Hippocampus Segmentation Using Patch-based Canonical Neural Network,"Over the past decades, state-of-the-art medical image segmentation has
heavily rested on signal processing paradigms, most notably registration-based
label propagation and pair-wise patch comparison, which are generally slow
despite a high segmentation accuracy. In recent years, deep learning has
revolutionalized computer vision with many practices outperforming prior art,
in particular the convolutional neural network (CNN) studies on image
classification. Deep CNN has also started being applied to medical image
segmentation lately, but generally involves long training and demanding memory
requirements, achieving limited success. We propose a patch-based deep learning
framework based on a revisit to the classic neural network model with
substantial modernization, including the use of Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)
activation, dropout layers, 2.5D tri-planar patch multi-pathway settings. In a
test application to hippocampus segmentation using 100 brain MR images from the
ADNI database, our approach significantly outperformed prior art in terms of
both segmentation accuracy and speed: scoring a median Dice score up to 90.98%
on a near real-time performance (<1s).","segmentation,image,CNN",Deep Learning
DSOR: A Scalable Statistical Filter for Removing Falling Snow from LiDAR Point Clouds in Severe Winter Weather,"For autonomous vehicles to viably replace human drivers they must contend
with inclement weather. Falling rain and snow introduce noise in LiDAR returns
resulting in both false positive and false negative object detections. In this
article we introduce the Winter Adverse Driving dataSet (WADS) collected in the
snow belt region of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. WADS is the first multi-modal
dataset featuring dense point-wise labeled sequential LiDAR scans collected in
severe winter weather; weather that would cause an experienced driver to alter
their driving behavior. We have labelled and will make available over 7 GB or
3.6 billion labelled LiDAR points out of over 26 TB of total LiDAR and camera
data collected. We also present the Dynamic Statistical Outlier Removal (DSOR)
filter, a statistical PCL-based filter capable or removing snow with a higher
recall than the state of the art snow de-noising filter while being 28\%
faster. Further, the DSOR filter is shown to have a lower time complexity
compared to the state of the art resulting in an improved scalability.

Approximability of Discriminators Implies Diversity in GANs,"While Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have empirically produced
impressive results on learning complex real-world distributions, recent works
have shown that they suffer from lack of diversity or mode collapse. The
theoretical work of Arora et al. suggests a dilemma about GANs' statistical
properties: powerful discriminators cause overfitting, whereas weak
discriminators cannot detect mode collapse.
By contrast, we show in this paper that GANs can in principle learn
distributions in Wasserstein distance (or KL-divergence in many cases) with
polynomial sample complexity, if the discriminator class has strong
distinguishing power against the particular generator class (instead of against
all possible generators). For various generator classes such as mixture of
Gaussians, exponential families, and invertible and injective neural networks
generators, we design corresponding discriminators (which are often neural nets
of specific architectures) such that the Integral Probability Metric (IPM)
induced by the discriminators can provably approximate the Wasserstein distance
and/or KL-divergence. This implies that if the training is successful, then the
learned distribution is close to the true distribution in Wasserstein distance
or KL divergence, and thus cannot drop modes. Our preliminary experiments show
that on synthetic datasets the test IPM is well correlated with KL divergence
or the Wasserstein distance, indicating that the lack of diversity in GANs may
be caused by the sub-optimality in optimization instead of statistical
inefficiency.","Wasserstein,Generative,Adversarial",Artificial Intelligence

Pareto Adversarial Robustness: Balancing Spatial Robustness and Sensitivity-based Robustness,"Adversarial robustness, which mainly contains sensitivity-based robustness
and spatial robustness, plays an integral part in the robust generalization. In
this paper, we endeavor to design strategies to achieve universal adversarial
robustness. To hit this target, we firstly investigate the less-studied spatial
robustness and then integrate existing spatial robustness methods by
incorporating both local and global spatial vulnerability into one spatial
attack and adversarial training. Based on this exploration, we further present
a comprehensive relationship between natural accuracy, sensitivity-based and
different spatial robustness, supported by the strong evidence from the
perspective of robust representation. More importantly, in order to balance
these mutual impacts of different robustness into one unified framework, we
incorporate \textit{Pareto criterion} into the adversarial robustness analysis,
yielding a novel strategy called \textit{Pareto Adversarial Training} towards
universal robustness. The resulting Pareto front, the set of optimal solutions,
provides the set of optimal balance among natural accuracy and different
adversarial robustness, shedding light on solutions towards universal
robustness in the future. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to
consider the universal adversarial robustness via multi-objective optimization.","robustness,Adversarial,spatial",Artificial Intelligence

Effect of Text Color on Word Embeddings,"In natural scenes and documents, we can find the correlation between a text
and its color. For instance, the word, ""hot"", is often printed in red, while
""cold"" is often in blue. This correlation can be thought of as a feature that
represents the semantic difference between the words. Based on this
observation, we propose the idea of using text color for word embeddings. While
text-only word embeddings (e.g. word2vec) have been extremely successful, they
often represent antonyms as similar since they are often interchangeable in
sentences. In this paper, we try two tasks to verify the usefulness of text
color in understanding the meanings of words, especially in identifying
synonyms and antonyms. First, we quantify the color distribution of words from
the book cover images and analyze the correlation between the color and meaning
of the word. Second, we try to retrain word embeddings with the color
distribution of words as a constraint. By observing the changes in the word
embeddings of synonyms and antonyms before and after re-training, we aim to
understand the kind of words that have positive or negative effects in their
word embeddings when incorporating text color information.","word,color,words",Science

Restormer: Efficient Transformer for High-Resolution Image Restoration,"Since convolutional neural networks (CNNs) perform well at learning
generalizable image priors from large-scale data, these models have been
extensively applied to image restoration and related tasks. Recently, another
class of neural architectures, Transformers, have shown significant performance
gains on natural language and high-level vision tasks. While the Transformer
model mitigates the shortcomings of CNNs (i.e., limited receptive field and
inadaptability to input content), its computational complexity grows
quadratically with the spatial resolution, therefore making it infeasible to
apply to most image restoration tasks involving high-resolution images. In this
work, we propose an efficient Transformer model by making several key designs
in the building blocks (multi-head attention and feed-forward network) such
that it can capture long-range pixel interactions, while still remaining
applicable to large images. Our model, named Restoration Transformer
(Restormer), achieves state-of-the-art results on several image restoration
tasks, including image deraining, single-image motion deblurring, defocus
deblurring (single-image and dual-pixel data), and image denoising (Gaussian

Part-based R-CNNs for Fine-grained Category Detection,"Semantic part localization can facilitate fine-grained categorization by
explicitly isolating subtle appearance differences associated with specific
object parts. Methods for pose-normalized representations have been proposed,
but generally presume bounding box annotations at test time due to the
difficulty of object detection. We propose a model for fine-grained
categorization that overcomes these limitations by leveraging deep
convolutional features computed on bottom-up region proposals. Our method
learns whole-object and part detectors, enforces learned geometric constraints
between them, and predicts a fine-grained category from a pose-normalized
representation. Experiments on the Caltech-UCSD bird dataset confirm that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art fine-grained categorization methods in an
end-to-end evaluation without requiring a bounding box at test time.","fine-grained,categorization,Semantic",Artificial Intelligence

continuous action setting and leverage this technique to combine expert
policies, as evaluated in the domain of simulated bipedal locomotion across
different classes of terrain. We also introduce an input injection method for
augmenting an existing policy network to exploit new input features. Lastly,

Introduction to Accounting Data Analytics and Visualization,"Accounting has always been about analytical thinking. From the earliest days of the profession, Luca Pacioli emphasized the importance of math and order for analyzing business transactions. The skillset that accountants have needed to perform math and to keep order has evolved from pencil and paper, to typewriters and calculators, then to spreadsheets and accounting software. A new skillset that is becoming more important for nearly every aspect of business is that of big data analytics: analyzing large amounts of data to find actionable insights. This course is designed to help accounting students develop an analytical mindset and prepare them to use data analytic programming languages like Python and R. We�ve divided the course into three main sections. In the first section, we bridge accountancy to analytics. We identify how tasks in the five major subdomains of accounting (i.e., financial, managerial, audit, tax, and systems) have historically required an analytical mindset, and we then explore how those tasks can be completed more effectively and efficiently by using big data analytics. We then present a FACT framework for guiding big data analytics: Frame a question, Assemble data, Calculate the data, and Tell others about the results. In the second section of the course, we emphasize the importance of assembling data. Using financial statement data, we explain desirable characteristics of both data and datasets that will lead to effective calculations and visualizations. In the third, and largest section of the course, we demonstrate and explore how Excel and Tableau can be used to analyze big data. We describe visual perception principles and then apply those principles to create effective visualizations. We then examine fundamental data analytic tools, such as regression, linear programming (using Excel Solver), and clustering in the context of point of sale data and loan data. We conclude by demonstrating the power of data analytic programming languages to assemble, visualize, and analyze data. We introduce Visual Basic for Applications as an example of a programming language, and the Visual Basic Editor as an example of an integrated development environment (IDE).","data,analytics,Accounting",Machine Learning

Regular Sequential Serializability and Regular Sequential Consistency,"Strictly serializable (linearizable) services appear to execute transactions
(operations) sequentially, in an order consistent with real time. This
restricts a transaction's (operation's) possible return values and in turn,
simplifies application programming. In exchange, strictly serializable
(linearizable) services perform worse than those with weaker consistency. But
switching to such services can break applications.
This work introduces two new consistency models to ease this trade-off:
regular sequential serializability (RSS) and regular sequential consistency
(RSC). They are just as strong for applications: we prove any application
invariant that holds when using a strictly serializable (linearizable) service
also holds when using an RSS (RSC) service. Yet they relax the constraints on
services -- they allow new, better-performing designs. To demonstrate this, we
design, implement, and evaluate variants of two systems, Spanner and Gryff,
relaxing their consistency to RSS and RSC, respectively. The new variants
achieve better read-only transaction and read tail latency than their
counterparts.","linearizable,serializable,RSC",Technology

Localizing Moments in Video with Natural Language,"We consider retrieving a specific temporal segment, or moment, from a video
given a natural language text description. Methods designed to retrieve whole
video clips with natural language determine what occurs in a video but not
when. To address this issue, we propose the Moment Context Network (MCN) which
effectively localizes natural language queries in videos by integrating local
and global video features over time. A key obstacle to training our MCN model
is that current video datasets do not include pairs of localized video segments
and referring expressions, or text descriptions which uniquely identify a
corresponding moment. Therefore, we collect the Distinct Describable Moments
(DiDeMo) dataset which consists of over 10,000 unedited, personal videos in
diverse visual settings with pairs of localized video segments and referring
expressions. We demonstrate that MCN outperforms several baseline methods and
believe that our initial results together with the release of DiDeMo will

Getting a Grip: in Materio Evolution of Membrane Morphology for Soft Robotic Jamming Grippers,"The application of granular jamming in soft robotics is a recent and
promising new technology offer exciting possibilities for creating higher
performance robotic devices. Granular jamming is achieved via the application
of a vacuum pressure inside a membrane containing particulate matter, and is
particularly interesting from a design perspective, as a myriad of design
parameters can potentially be exploited to induce a diverse variety of useful
behaviours. To date, the effect of variables such as grain shape and size, as
well as membrane material, have been studied as a means of inducing bespoke
gripping performance, however the other main contributing factor, membrane
morphology, has not been studied due to its particular complexities in both
accurate modelling and fabrication. This research presents the first study that
optimises membrane morphology for granular jamming grippers, combining
multi-material 3D printing and an evolutionary algorithm to search through a
varied morphology design space in materio. Entire generations are printed in a
single run and gripper retention force is tested and used as a fitness measure.
Our approach is relatively scalable, circumvents the need for modelling, and
guarantees the real-world performance of the grippers considered. Results show
that membrane morphology is a key determinant of gripper performance. Common
high performance designs are seen to optimise all three of the main identified
mechanisms by which granular grippers generate grip force, are significantly
different from a standard gripper morphology, and generalise well across a
range of test objects.","membrane,granular,morphology",Science
Recommender Systems meet Mechanism Design,"Machine learning has developed a variety of tools for learning and
representing high-dimensional distributions with structure. Recent years have
also seen big advances in designing multi-item mechanisms. Akin to overfitting,
however, these mechanisms can be extremely sensitive to the Bayesian prior that
they target, which becomes problematic when that prior is only approximately
known. We consider a multi-item mechanism design problem where the bidders'
value distributions can be approximated by a topic model. Our solution builds
on a recent robustification framework by Brustle et al., which disentangles the
statistical challenge of estimating a multi-dimensional prior from the task of
designing a good mechanism for it, robustifying the performance of the latter
against the estimation error of the former. We provide an extension of the
framework that allows us to exploit the expressive power of topic models to
reduce the effective dimensionality of the mechanism design problem.","learning,mechanism,prior",Machine Learning

state-of-the-art object detection techniques designed for images captured using
ground-level sensors usually experience a sharp performance drop when directly
applied to remote sensing images, largely due to the object appearance
differences in remote sensing images in term of sparse texture, low contrast,
arbitrary orientations, large scale variations, etc. This paper presents a
novel object detection network (CAD-Net) that exploits attention-modulated
features as well as global and local contexts to address the new challenges in
detecting objects from remote sensing images. The proposed CAD-Net learns
global and local contexts of objects by capturing their correlations with the
global scene (at scene-level) and the local neighboring objects or features (at
object-level), respectively. In addition, it designs a spatial-and-scale-aware
attention module that guides the network to focus on more informative regions
and features as well as more appropriate feature scales. Experiments over two
publicly available object detection datasets for remote sensing images
demonstrate that the proposed CAD-Net achieves superior detection performance.
The implementation codes will be made publicly available for facilitating
future researches.","sensing,images,remote",Artificial Intelligence

Imaging low-mass planets within the habitable zones of nearby stars with ground-based mid-infrared imaging,"Giant exoplanets on 10-100 au orbits have been directly imaged around young
stars. The peak of the thermal emission from these warm young planets is in the
near-infrared (~1-5 microns), whereas mature, temperate exoplanets (i.e., those
within their stars' habitable zones) radiate primarily in the mid-infrared
(mid-IR: ~10 microns). If the background noise in the mid-IR can be mitigated,
then exoplanets with low masses--including rocky exoplanets--can potentially be
imaged in very deep exposures. Here, we review the recent results of the
Breakthrough Watch/New Earths in the Alpha Centauri Region (NEAR) program on
the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile. NEAR pioneered a ground-based mid-IR
observing approach designed to push the capabilities for exoplanet imaging with
a specific focus on the closest stellar system, Alpha Centauri. NEAR combined
several new optical technologies--including a mid-IR optimized coronagraph,
adaptive optics system, and rapid chopping strategy to mitigate noise from the
central star and thermal background within the habitable zone. We focus on the
lessons of the VLT/NEAR campaign to improve future
instrumentation--specifically on strategies to improve noise mitigation through
chopping. We also present the design and commissioning of the Large Binocular
Telescope's Exploratory Survey for Super-Earths Orbiting Nearby Stars
(LESSONS), an experiment in the Northern hemisphere that is building on what
was learned from NEAR to further push the sensitivity of mid-IR imaging.
Finally, we briefly discuss some of the possibilities that mid-IR imaging will
enable for exoplanet science.","mid-IR,exoplanets,young",Science
Welch-GAN: Generating realistic photoplethysmography signal from frequency-domain for atrial fibrillation detection,"Training machine learning algorithms from a small and imbalanced dataset is
often a daunting challenge in medical research. However, it has been shown that
the synthetic data generated by data augmentation techniques can enlarge the
dataset and contribute to alleviating the imbalance situation. In this study,
we propose a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture-Welch-GAN
and focused on examining how its influence on classifier performance is related
to signal quality and class imbalance within the context of
photoplethysmography (PPG)-based atrial fibrillation (AF) detection. Pulse
oximetry data were collected from 126 adult patients and augmented using the
permutation technique to build a large training set for training an AF
detection model based on a one-dimensional residual neural network. To test the
model, PPG data were collected from 13 stroke patients and utilized. Four data
augmentation methods, including both traditional and GANs, are leveraged as
baseline in this study. Three different experiments are designed to investigate
each data augmentation methods from the aspect of performance gain, robustness
to motion artifact and training sample size, respectively. Compared to the
un-augmented data, by training the same AF classification algorithm using
augmented data, the AF detection accuracy was significantly improved from
80.36% to over 90% with no compromise on sensitivity nor on negative predicted
value. Within each data augmentation techniques, Welch-GAN has shown around 3%
superiority in terms of AF detection accuracy compared to the baseline methods,
which suggests the state-of-the-art of our proposed Welch-GAN.","data,augmentation,detection",Deep Learning

MRI-compatible electromagnetic servomotors for image-guided robotic procedures,"Combining the unmatched soft-tissue imaging capabilities of magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) with high precision robotics has the potential to
improve the accuracy, precision, and safety of a wide range of image-guided
medical procedures. However, the goal of highly functional MRI-compatible
robotic systems has not yet been realized because conventional electromagnetic
servomotors used by medical robots can become dangerous projectiles near the
strong magnetic field of an MRI scanner. Here we report a novel electromagnetic
servomotor design that is constructed from non-magnetic components and can
operate within the patient area of clinical scanners. We show that this design
enables high-torque and precisely controlled rotary actuation during imaging.
Using this servomotor design, an MRI-compatible robot was constructed and
tested. The robot demonstrated that the linear forces required to manipulate
large diameter surgical instruments in tissues could be achieved during
simultaneous imaging with MRI. This work presents the first fully functional
electromagnetic servomotor that can be safely operated (while imaging) in the
patient area of a 3 Tesla clinical MRI scanner.","MRI,precision,imaging",Science
Multi-Attention Multi-Class Constraint for Fine-grained Image Recognition,"Attention-based learning for fine-grained image recognition remains a
challenging task, where most of the existing methods treat each object part in
isolation, while neglecting the correlations among them. In addition, the
multi-stage or multi-scale mechanisms involved make the existing methods less
efficient and hard to be trained end-to-end. In this paper, we propose a novel
attention-based convolutional neural network (CNN) which regulates multiple
object parts among different input images. Our method first learns multiple
attention region features of each input image through the one-squeeze
multi-excitation (OSME) module, and then apply the multi-attention multi-class
constraint (MAMC) in a metric learning framework. For each anchor feature, the
MAMC functions by pulling same-attention same-class features closer, while
pushing different-attention or different-class features away. Our method can be
easily trained end-to-end, and is highly efficient which requires only one
training stage. Moreover, we introduce Dogs-in-the-Wild, a comprehensive dog
species dataset that surpasses similar existing datasets by category coverage,
data volume and annotation quality. This dataset will be released upon
acceptance to facilitate the research of fine-grained image recognition.
Extensive experiments are conducted to show the substantial improvements of our
method on four benchmark datasets.","existing,image,method",Deep Learning

end-to-end solution, MBCNN respectively solves the two sub-problems. For
texture restoration, we propose a learnable bandpass filter (LBF) to learn the
frequency prior for moire texture removal. For color restoration, we propose a
two-step tone mapping strategy, which first applies a global tone mapping to
correct for a global color shift, and then performs local fine tuning of the
color per pixel. Through an ablation study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
the different components of MBCNN. Experimental results on two public datasets

Figure Captioning with Reasoning and Sequence-Level Training,"Figures, such as bar charts, pie charts, and line plots, are widely used to
convey important information in a concise format. They are usually
human-friendly but difficult for computers to process automatically. In this
work, we investigate the problem of figure captioning where the goal is to
automatically generate a natural language description of the figure. While
natural image captioning has been studied extensively, figure captioning has
received relatively little attention and remains a challenging problem. First,
we introduce a new dataset for figure captioning, FigCAP, based on FigureQA.
Second, we propose two novel attention mechanisms. To achieve accurate
generation of labels in figures, we propose Label Maps Attention. To model the
relations between figure labels, we propose Relation Maps Attention. Third, we
use sequence-level training with reinforcement learning in order to directly
optimizes evaluation metrics, which alleviates the exposure bias issue and
further improves the models in generating long captions. Extensive experiments
show that the proposed method outperforms the baselines, thus demonstrating a
significant potential for the automatic captioning of vast repositories of
figures.","charts,captioning,figure",Deep Learning

User-driven Design and Evaluation of Liquid Types in Java,"Bugs that are detected earlier during the development lifecycle are easier
and cheaper to fix, whereas bugs that are found during production are difficult
and expensive to address, and may have dire consequences. Type systems are
particularly effective at identifying and preventing bugs early in the
development lifecycle by causing invalid programs to result in build failure.
Liquid Types are more powerful than those found in mainstream programming
languages, allowing the detection of more classes of bugs. However, while
Liquid Types were proposed in 2008 with their integration in ML and
subsequently introduced in C (2012), Javascript(2012) and Haskell(2014) through
language extensions, they have yet to become widely adopted by mainstream
developers. This paper investigates how Liquid Types can be integrated in a
mainstream programming language, Java, by proposing a new design that aims to
lower the barrier to entry and adapts to problems that Java developers commonly
encounter at runtime. To promote accessibility, we conducted a series of
developer surveys to design the syntax of LiquidJava, our prototype. To
evaluate the prototype's usability, we conducted a user study of 30 Java
developers, concluding that users intend to use LiquidJava and that it helped
to find more bugs and debug faster.","Bugs,Types,Java",App Dev
Applications of Earth-to-Air Heat Exchangers: A Holistic Review,"The building sector is responsible for 40% of primary energy consumption,
with heating/cooling covering the most significant portion. Thus, passive
heating/cooling applications have gained significant ground during the last

cooling/heating applications, ground cooling (especially earth-to-air heat
exchangers) has been highlighted as a remarkably attractive technological
research subjects because of its significant contribution to the reduction of
heating/cooling energy loads; the improvement of indoor thermal comfort
conditions; and the amelioration of the urban environment. This paper presents
a holistic review of state-of-the-art research, methodologies, and technologies
of earth-to-air heat exchangers that help achieve energy conservation and
thermal comfort in the built environment. The review covers the critical
subject of the thermal performance of earth-to-air heat exchanger systems;
experimental studies and applications; parametric studies for investigating the
impact of their main characteristics on thermal efficiency; and recent advances
and trends including hybrid technologies and systems. The models describing the
thermal performance of earth-to-air heat exchangers systems were classified in
numerical, analytical, and data-driven; their main theoretical principles were
presented; and experimental validation was mentioned when carried out. System
parameters were grouped into three categories: system design, soil types, and
soil surface coverage. System design parameters, especially length and burial
depth, bore the most important influence on the thermal efficiency of the
system. The paper was rounded up with an economic assessment of system
application, and the conclusions highlighted the need for more experimental
work including laboratory simulators.","cooling,thermal,heating",Science
Exploration in Approximate Hyper-State Space for Meta Reinforcement Learning,"To rapidly learn a new task, it is often essential for agents to explore
efficiently -- especially when performance matters from the first timestep. One
way to learn such behaviour is via meta-learning. Many existing methods however
rely on dense rewards for meta-training, and can fail catastrophically if the
rewards are sparse. Without a suitable reward signal, the need for exploration
during meta-training is exacerbated. To address this, we propose HyperX, which
uses novel reward bonuses for meta-training to explore in approximate
hyper-state space (where hyper-states represent the environment state and the
agent's task belief). We show empirically that HyperX meta-learns better
task-exploration and adapts more successfully to new tasks than existing
methods.","learn,efficiently,timestep",Artificial Intelligence

In-pixel automatic threshold calibration for the CMS Endcap Timing Layer readout chip,"We present the implementation and verification of an in-pixel automatic
threshold calibration circuit for the CMS Endcap Timing Layer (ETL) in the
High-Luminosity LHC upgrade. The discriminator threshold of the ETL readout
chip (ETROC) needs to be calibrated regularly to mitigate the circuit baseline
change. Traditional methods need a lot of communication through a slow control
system hence are time-consuming. This paper describes an in-pixel automatic
scheme with improvements in operating time and usability. In this scheme, a
sample-accumulation circuit is used to measure the average discriminator
output. A binary successive approximation and linear combination scan are
applied to find the equivalent baseline. The actual calibration procedure has
been first implemented in FPGA firmware and tested with the ETROC front-end
prototype chip (ETROC0). The calibration circuit has been implemented with
Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) and verified with Single Event Effects (SEEs)
simulation. A complete calibration process lasts 35 ms with a 40 MHz clock. In
the worst case, the dynamic and static power consumption are estimated to be
300 uW and 10.4 uW, respectively. The circuit design, implemented in a 65 CMOS

Interweaving polar charge orders in a layered metallic super-atomic,"Electronic properties of super-atomic crystals are far from being well
explored in the case of their versatile building units and premature
understanding of their inter-unit couplings. Here, we experiment-theory jointly
investigated a rational-designed layered super-atomic crystal of Au6Te12Se8
cubes, stacked through non-covalent inter-cube quasi-bonds. We found a
sequential-emerged anisotropic triple-cube charge-density-wave and spatially
polarized metallic states below 120 K, as examined using scanning tunneling
microscopy/spectroscopy, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, transport
measurement, Raman spectra and density functional theory. The polarized states
are locked in an anti-parallel configuration, required by maintaining the
inversion symmetry of the center-cube of a tri-cube group. The anti-polar
metallic states are thus interweaved by the charge density wave and the
polarized metallic states, primarily ascribed to electronic effects rather than
atomic displacements. This work demonstrated that strong electronic
interactions could play an essential role in determining electronic properties
of non-covalent super-atomic solids, which shed considerable light on expanding

Box-Adapt: Domain-Adaptive Medical Image Segmentation using Bounding BoxSupervision,"Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in medicalimage segmentation,
but it usually requires a large numberof images labeled with fine-grained
segmentation masks, andthe annotation of these masks can be very expensive
andtime-consuming. Therefore, recent methods try to use un-supervised domain
adaptation (UDA) methods to borrow in-formation from labeled data from other
datasets (source do-mains) to a new dataset (target domain). However, due tothe
absence of labels in the target domain, the performance ofUDA methods is much
worse than that of the fully supervisedmethod. In this paper, we propose a
weakly supervised do-main adaptation setting, in which we can partially label
newdatasets with bounding boxes, which are easier and cheaperto obtain than
segmentation masks. Accordingly, we proposea new weakly-supervised domain
adaptation method calledBox-Adapt, which fully explores the fine-grained
segmenta-tion mask in the source domain and the weak bounding boxin the target
domain. Our Box-Adapt is a two-stage methodthat first performs joint training
on the source and target do-mains, and then conducts self-training with the

Impact of Spin-Orbit Coupling on Quantum Transport in Magnetic Tunnel Junction with an anti-ferromagnetic Capping Layer,"Using first-principles calculations, we explore the role of an
anti-ferromagnetic heavy-metal, L1$_0$-IrMn, as a capping layer in a
perpendicular magnetic tunnel junction (\emph{p}-MTJ). A comparative study is
conducted by employing conventional non-magnetic heavy-metals (Ta, W or Mo)
capping layers along with an anti-ferromagnetic IrMn in a symmetric-MTJ
X/FeCo/MgO/FeCo/X, where X=Ta, W, Mo or IrMn. Firstly, the calculations without
including spin-orbit coupling (SOC) are presented where the highest TMR is
achieved in IrMn-IrMn MTJ compared to that of Ta-Ta, W-W and Mo-Mo MTJs. The
origin of this large TMR is attributed to, both, the large spin-polarization
due to reduced lattice-mismatch and the non-identical signatures of both the
anti-parallel conduction-channels caused by the anti-ferromagnetic ordering of
IrMn that reflects the spins at IrMn/FeCo interface. Moreover, when SOC is
switched-on, the increase of TMR is observed in all the MTJs with a
particularly giant enhancement in IrMn-IrMn MTJ. This SOC-induced increase in
TMR is ascribed to the mixed contribution of $\Delta_1$ and $\Delta_5$ states
and the additional increase in the band levels of the out-of-plane orbitals,
\emph{p}$_z$, \emph{d}$_{z}^2$ and \emph{d}$_{xz}$ due to the lifting of
degeneracy. Furthermore, it was also observed that the lattice-mismatch-induced
strain might create an orbital reconstruction within the capping layer,
probably, due to the crystallographic deformation and, in turn, in the adjacent
FeCo-electrode. This microscopic mechanism also plays an additional decisive
role in enhancing the TMR. Finally, our results indicate that IrMn can offer
giant TMR in future spin-orbit toque (SOT) based MRAM devices with a
straightforward design strategy.","TMR,IrMn,emph",Science

Predicting Head Movement in Panoramic Video: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach,"Panoramic video provides immersive and interactive experience by enabling
humans to control the field of view (FoV) through head movement (HM). Thus, HM
plays a key role in modeling human attention on panoramic video. This paper
establishes a database collecting subjects' HM in panoramic video sequences.
From this database, we find that the HM data are highly consistent across
subjects. Furthermore, we find that deep reinforcement learning (DRL) can be
applied to predict HM positions, via maximizing the reward of imitating human
HM scanpaths through the agent's actions. Based on our findings, we propose a
DRL-based HM prediction (DHP) approach with offline and online versions, called
offline-DHP and online-DHP. In offline-DHP, multiple DRL workflows are run to
determine potential HM positions at each panoramic frame. Then, a heat map of
the potential HM positions, named the HM map, is generated as the output of
offline-DHP. In online-DHP, the next HM position of one subject is estimated
given the currently observed HM position, which is achieved by developing a DRL
algorithm upon the learned offline-DHP model. Finally, the experiments validate
that our approach is effective in both offline and online prediction of HM
positions for panoramic video, and that the learned offline-DHP model can
improve the performance of online-DHP.","Panoramic,video,offline-DHP",Artificial Intelligence

Ensemble Grammar Induction For Detecting Anomalies in Time Series,"Time series anomaly detection is an important task, with applications in a
broad variety of domains. Many approaches have been proposed in recent years,
but often they require that the length of the anomalies be known in advance and
provided as an input parameter. This limits the practicality of the algorithms,
as such information is often unknown in advance, or anomalies with different
lengths might co-exist in the data. To address this limitation, previously, a
linear time anomaly detection algorithm based on grammar induction has been
proposed. While the algorithm can find variable-length patterns, it still
requires preselecting values for at least two parameters at the discretization
step. How to choose these parameter values properly is still an open problem.
In this paper, we introduce a grammar-induction-based anomaly detection method
utilizing ensemble learning. Instead of using a particular choice of parameter
values for anomaly detection, the method generates the final result based on a
set of results obtained using different parameter values. We demonstrate that
the proposed ensemble approach can outperform existing grammar-induction-based
approaches with different criteria for selection of parameter values. We also
show that the proposed approach can achieve performance similar to that of the
state-of-the-art distance-based anomaly detection algorithm.","detection,parameter,anomaly",Deep Learning

Panoramic Learning with A Standardized Machine Learning Formalism,"Machine Learning (ML) is about computational methods that enable machines to
learn concepts from experiences. In handling a wide variety of experiences
ranging from data instances, knowledge, constraints, to rewards, adversaries,
and lifelong interplay in an ever-growing spectrum of tasks, contemporary ML/AI
research has resulted in a multitude of learning paradigms and methodologies.
Despite the continual progresses on all different fronts, the disparate
narrowly-focused methods also make standardized, composable, and reusable
development of learning solutions difficult, and make it costly if possible to
build AI agents that panoramically learn from all types of experiences. This
paper presents a standardized ML formalism, in particular a standard equation
of the learning objective, that offers a unifying understanding of diverse ML
algorithms, making them special cases due to different choices of modeling
components. The framework also provides guidance for mechanic design of new ML
solutions, and serves as a promising vehicle towards panoramic learning with
all experiences.","Learning,experiences,Machine",Machine Learning

Automatic Semantic Segmentation of the Lumbar Spine. Clinical Applicability in a Multi-parametric and Multi-centre MRI study,"One of the major difficulties in medical image segmentation is the high
variability of these images, which is caused by their origin (multi-centre),
the acquisition protocols (multi-parametric), as well as the variability of
human anatomy, the severity of the illness, the effect of age and gender, among
others. The problem addressed in this work is the automatic semantic
segmentation of lumbar spine Magnetic Resonance images using convolutional
neural networks. The purpose is to assign a classes label to each pixel of an
image. Classes were defined by radiologists and correspond to different
structural elements like vertebrae, intervertebral discs, nerves, blood
vessels, and other tissues. The proposed network topologies are variants of the
U-Net architecture. Several complementary blocks were used to define the
variants: Three types of convolutional blocks, spatial attention models, deep
supervision and multilevel feature extractor. This document describes the
topologies and analyses the results of the neural network designs that obtained
the most accurate segmentations. Several of the proposed designs outperform the
standard U-Net used as baseline, especially when used in ensembles where the
output of multiple neural networks is combined according to different
strategies.","variability,image,images",Deep Learning

Machine Learning for Mediation in Armed Conflicts,"Today's conflicts are becoming increasingly complex, fluid and fragmented,
often involving a host of national and international actors with multiple and
often divergent interests. This development poses significant challenges for
conflict mediation, as mediators struggle to make sense of conflict dynamics,
such as the range of conflict parties and the evolution of their political
positions, the distinction between relevant and less relevant actors in peace
making, or the identification of key conflict issues and their interdependence.
International peace efforts appear increasingly ill-equipped to successfully
address these challenges. While technology is being increasingly used in a
range of conflict related fields, such as conflict predicting or information
gathering, less attention has been given to how technology can contribute to
conflict mediation. This case study is the first to apply state-of-the-art
machine learning technologies to data from an ongoing mediation process. Using
dialogue transcripts from peace negotiations in Yemen, this study shows how
machine-learning tools can effectively support international mediators by
managing knowledge and offering additional conflict analysis tools to assess
complex information. Apart from illustrating the potential of machine learning
tools in conflict mediation, the paper also emphasises the importance of
interdisciplinary and participatory research design for the development of
context-sensitive and targeted tools and to ensure meaningful and responsible
implementation.","conflict,mediation,tools",Machine Learning

Competitive Perimeter Defense of Conical Environments,"We consider a perimeter defense problem in a planar conical environment in
which a single vehicle, having a finite capture radius, aims to defend a
concentric perimeter from mobile intruders. The intruders are arbitrarily
released at the circumference of the environment and move radially toward the
perimeter with fixed speed. We present a competitive analysis approach to this
problem by measuring the performance of multiple online algorithms for the
vehicle against arbitrary inputs, relative to an optimal offline algorithm that
has access to all future inputs. In particular, we first establish a necessary
condition on the parameter space to guarantee finite competitiveness of any
algorithm, and then characterize a parameter regime in which the competitive
ratio is guaranteed to be at least 2 for any algorithm. We then design and
analyze three online algorithms and characterize parameter regimes for which
they have finite competitive ratios. Specifically, our first two algorithms are
provably 1, and 2-competitive, respectively, whereas our third algorithm
exhibits a finite competitive ratio that depends on the problem parameters.
Finally, we provide numerous parameter space plots providing insights into the
relative performance of our algorithms.","perimeter,competitive,finite",Artificial Intelligence
Capacity Optimal Generalized Multi-User MIMO: A Theoretical and Practical Framework,"Conventional multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) mainly
focused on Gaussian signaling, independent and identically distributed (IID)
channels, and a limited number of users. It will be laborious to cope with the
heterogeneous requirements in next-generation wireless communications, such as
various transmission data, complicated communication scenarios, and massive
user access. Therefore, this paper studies a generalized MU-MIMO (GMU-MIMO)
system with more practical constraints, i.e., non-Gaussian signaling, non-IID
channel, and massive users and antennas. These generalized assumptions bring
new challenges in theory and practice. For example, there is no accurate
capacity analysis for GMU-MIMO. In addition, it is unclear how to achieve the
capacity optimal performance with practical complexity.
To address these challenges, a unified framework is proposed to derive the
GMU-MIMO capacity and design a capacity optimal transceiver, which jointly
considers encoding, modulation, detection, and decoding. Group asymmetry is
developed to make a tradeoff between user rate allocation and implementation
complexity. Specifically, the capacity region of group asymmetric GMU-MIMO is
characterized by using the celebrated mutual information and minimum
mean-square error (MMSE) lemma and the MMSE optimality of orthogonal
approximate message passing (OAMP)/vector AMP (VAMP). Furthermore, a
theoretically optimal multi-user OAMP/VAMP receiver and practical multi-user
low-density parity-check (MU-LDPC) codes are proposed to achieve the capacity
region of group asymmetric GMU-MIMO. Numerical results verify that the gaps
between theoretical detection thresholds of the proposed framework with
optimized MU-LDPC codes and QPSK modulation and the sum capacity of GMU-MIMO
are about 0.2 dB. Moreover, their finite-length performances are about 1~2 dB
away from the associated sum capacity.","capacity,IID,Gaussian",Science
Oriented Objects as pairs of Middle Lines,"The detection of oriented objects is frequently appeared in the field of
natural scene text detection as well as object detection in aerial images.
Traditional detectors for oriented objects are common to rotate anchors on the
basis of the RCNN frameworks, which will multiple the number of anchors with a
variety of angles, coupled with rotating NMS algorithm, the computational
complexities of these models are greatly increased. In this paper, we propose a
novel model named Oriented Objects Detection Network O^2-DNet to detect
oriented objects by predicting a pair of middle lines inside each target.
O^2-DNet is an one-stage, anchor-free and NMS-free model. The target line
segments of our model are defined as two corresponding middle lines of original
rotating bounding box annotations which can be transformed directly instead of
additional manual tagging. Experiments show that our O^2-DNet achieves
excellent performance on ICDAR 2015 and DOTA datasets. It is noteworthy that
the objects in COCO can be regard as a special form of oriented objects with an
angle of 90 degrees. O^2-DNet can still achieve competitive results in these
general natural object detection datasets.","oriented,objects,detection",Deep Learning

Resisting Out-of-Distribution Data Problem in Perturbation of XAI,"With the rapid development of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI),
perturbation-based XAI algorithms have become quite popular due to their
effectiveness and ease of implementation. The vast majority of
perturbation-based XAI techniques face the challenge of Out-of-Distribution
(OoD) data -- an artifact of randomly perturbed data becoming inconsistent with
the original dataset. OoD data leads to the over-confidence problem in model
predictions, making the existing XAI approaches unreliable. To our best
knowledge, the OoD data problem in perturbation-based XAI algorithms has not
been adequately addressed in the literature. In this work, we address this OoD
data problem by designing an additional module quantifying the affinity between
the perturbed data and the original dataset distribution, which is integrated
into the process of aggregation. Our solution is shown to be compatible with
the most popular perturbation-based XAI algorithms, such as RISE, OCCLUSION,
and LIME. Experiments have confirmed that our methods demonstrate a significant
improvement in general cases using both computational and cognitive metrics.
Especially in the case of degradation, our proposed approach demonstrates
outstanding performance comparing to baselines. Besides, our solution also
resolves a fundamental problem with the faithfulness indicator, a commonly used
evaluation metric of XAI algorithms that appears to be sensitive to the OoD
issue.","XAI,data,OoD",Artificial Intelligence
SelectFusion: A Generic Framework to Selectively Learn Multisensory Fusion,"Autonomous vehicles and mobile robotic systems are typically equipped with
multiple sensors to provide redundancy. By integrating the observations from
different sensors, these mobile agents are able to perceive the environment and
estimate system states, e.g. locations and orientations. Although deep learning
approaches for multimodal odometry estimation and localization have gained
traction, they rarely focus on the issue of robust sensor fusion - a necessary
consideration to deal with noisy or incomplete sensor observations in the real
world. Moreover, current deep odometry models also suffer from a lack of
interpretability. To this extent, we propose SelectFusion, an end-to-end
selective sensor fusion module which can be applied to useful pairs of sensor
modalities such as monocular images and inertial measurements, depth images and
LIDAR point clouds. During prediction, the network is able to assess the
reliability of the latent features from different sensor modalities and
estimate both trajectory at scale and global pose. In particular, we propose
two fusion modules based on different attention strategies: deterministic soft
fusion and stochastic hard fusion, and we offer a comprehensive study of the
new strategies compared to trivial direct fusion. We evaluate all fusion
strategies in both ideal conditions and on progressively degraded datasets that
present occlusions, noisy and missing data and time misalignment between
sensors, and we investigate the effectiveness of the different fusion
strategies in attending the most reliable features, which in itself, provides
insights into the operation of the various models.","fusion,sensor,sensors",Technology
Self-Supervised Graph Representation Learning via Global Context Prediction,"To take full advantage of fast-growing unlabeled networked data, this paper
introduces a novel self-supervised strategy for graph representation learning
by exploiting natural supervision provided by the data itself. Inspired by
human social behavior, we assume that the global context of each node is
composed of all nodes in the graph since two arbitrary entities in a connected
network could interact with each other via paths of varying length. Based on
this, we investigate whether the global context can be a source of free and
effective supervisory signals for learning useful node representations.
Specifically, we randomly select pairs of nodes in a graph and train a
well-designed neural net to predict the contextual position of one node
relative to the other. Our underlying hypothesis is that the representations
learned from such within-graph context would capture the global topology of the
graph and finely characterize the similarity and differentiation between nodes,
which is conducive to various downstream learning tasks. Extensive benchmark
experiments including node classification, clustering, and link prediction
demonstrate that our approach outperforms many state-of-the-art unsupervised
methods and sometimes even exceeds the performance of supervised counterparts.","data,graph,global",Deep Learning
Automotive Radar Data Acquisition using Object Detection,"The growing urban complexity demands an efficient algorithm to acquire and
process various sensor information from autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we
introduce an algorithm to utilize object detection results from the image to
adaptively sample and acquire radar data using Compressed Sensing (CS). This
novel algorithm is motivated by the hypothesis that with a limited sampling
budget, allocating more sampling budget to areas with the object as opposed to
a uniform sampling ultimately improves relevant object detection performance.
We improve detection performance by dynamically allocating a lower sampling
rate to objects such as buses than pedestrians leading to better reconstruction
than baseline across areas with objects of interest. We automate the sampling
rate allocation using linear programming and show significant time savings
while reducing the radar block size by a factor of 2. We also analyze a Binary
Permuted Diagonal measurement matrix for radar acquisition which is
hardware-efficient and show its performance is similar to Gaussian and Binary
Permuted Block Diagonal matrix. Our experiments on the Oxford radar dataset
show an effective reconstruction of objects of interest with 10% sampling rate.
Finally, we develop a transformer-based 2D object detection network using the
NuScenes radar and image data.","sampling,detection,radar",Science

Unsupervised Learning of Object Structure and Dynamics from Videos,"Extracting and predicting object structure and dynamics from videos without
supervision is a major challenge in machine learning. To address this
challenge, we adopt a keypoint-based image representation and learn a
stochastic dynamics model of the keypoints. Future frames are reconstructed
from the keypoints and a reference frame. By modeling dynamics in the keypoint
coordinate space, we achieve stable learning and avoid compounding of errors in
pixel space. Our method improves upon unstructured representations both for
pixel-level video prediction and for downstream tasks requiring object-level
understanding of motion dynamics. We evaluate our model on diverse datasets: a
multi-agent sports dataset, the Human3.6M dataset, and datasets based on
continuous control tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite. The spatially
structured representation outperforms unstructured representations on a range
of motion-related tasks such as object tracking, action recognition and reward

An algorithmic study in the vector model for Wireless Power Transfer maximization,"Rapid technological advances in the domain of Wireless Power Transfer (WPT)
pave the way for novel methods for power management in systems of wireless
devices and recent research works have already started considering algorithmic
solutions for tackling emerging problems. However, many of those works are
limited by the system modelling, and more specifically the one-dimensional
abstraction suggested by Friis formula for the power received by one antenna
under idealized conditions given another antenna some distance away. Different
to those works, we use a model which arises naturally from fundamental
properties of the superposition of energy fields. This model has been shown to
be more realistic than other one-dimensional models that have been used in the
past and can capture superadditive and cancellation effects. Under this model,
we define two new interesting problems for configuring the wireless power
transmitters so as to maximize the total power in the system and we prove that
the first problem can be solved in polynomial time. We present a distributed
solution that runs in pseudo-polynomial time and uses various knowledge levels
and we provide theoretical performance guarantees. Finally, we design three
heuristics for the second problem and evaluate them via simulations.","Power,WPT,Transfer",Science
Ultrasound Video Summarization using Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Video is an essential imaging modality for diagnostics, e.g. in ultrasound

a lot of attention in the medical image analysis community. In the clinical

video data takes a long time to process, annotate or audit. In this paper we
introduce a novel, fully automatic video summarization method that is tailored
to the needs of medical video data. Our approach is framed as reinforcement
learning problem and produces agents focusing on the preservation of important
diagnostic information. We evaluate our method on videos from fetal ultrasound
screening, where commonly only a small amount of the recorded data is used
diagnostically. We show that our method is superior to alternative video

clinical diagnostic standards.","Video,imaging,data",Deep Learning

Learning Geometry-Guided Depth via Projective Modeling for Monocular 3D Object Detection,"As a crucial task of autonomous driving, 3D object detection has made great
progress in recent years. However, monocular 3D object detection remains a
challenging problem due to the unsatisfactory performance in depth estimation.
Most existing monocular methods typically directly regress the scene depth
while ignoring important relationships between the depth and various geometric
elements (e.g. bounding box sizes, 3D object dimensions, and object poses). In
this paper, we propose to learn geometry-guided depth estimation with
projective modeling to advance monocular 3D object detection. Specifically, a
principled geometry formula with projective modeling of 2D and 3D depth
predictions in the monocular 3D object detection network is devised. We further
implement and embed the proposed formula to enable geometry-aware deep
representation learning, allowing effective 2D and 3D interactions for boosting
the depth estimation. Moreover, we provide a strong baseline through addressing
substantial misalignment between 2D annotation and projected boxes to ensure
robust learning with the proposed geometric formula. Experiments on the KITTI
dataset show that our method remarkably improves the detection performance of
the state-of-the-art monocular-based method without extra data by 2.80% on the
moderate test setting. The model and code will be released at

PakeMail: authentication and key management in decentralized secure email and messaging via PAKE,"We propose the use of PAKE for achieving and enhancing entity authentication
(EA) and key management (KM) in the context of decentralized end-to-end
encrypted email and secure messaging, i.e., where neither a public key
infrastructure nor trusted third parties are used. This approach not only
simplifies the EA process by requiring users to share only a low-entropy
secret, e.g., a memorable word, but it also allows us to establish a
high-entropy secret key; this key enables a series of cryptographic
enhancements and security properties, which are hard to achieve using
out-of-band (OOB) authentication. We first study a few vulnerabilities in
voice-based OOB authentication, in particular a combinatorial attack against
lazy users, which we analyze in the context of a secure email solution. We then
propose tackling public key authentication by solving the problem of ""secure
equality test"" using PAKE, and discuss various protocols and their properties.
This method enables the automation of important KM tasks (e.g. key renewal and
future key pair authentications), reduces the impact of human errors, and lends
itself to the asynchronous nature of email and modern messaging. It also
provides cryptographic enhancements including multi-device synchronization and
secure secret storage/retrieval, and paves the path for forward secrecy,
deniability and post-quantum security. We also discuss the use of auditable
PAKEs for mitigating a class of online guess and abort attacks in
authentication protocols. To demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal, we
present PakeMail, an implementation of the core idea, and discuss some of its
cryptographic details, implemented features and efficiency aspects. We conclude
with some design and security considerations, followed by future lines of work.","key,authentication,secure",Cryptography

Neural Generative Models for 3D Faces with Application in 3D Texture Free Face Recognition,"Using heterogeneous depth cameras and 3D scanners in 3D face verification
causes variations in the resolution of the 3D point clouds. To solve this
issue, previous studies use 3D registration techniques. Out of these proposed
techniques, detecting points of correspondence is proven to be an efficient
method given that the data belongs to the same individual. However, if the data
belongs to different persons, the registration algorithms can convert the 3D
point cloud of one person to another, destroying the distinguishing features
between the two point clouds. Another issue regarding the storage size of the
point clouds. That is, if the captured depth image contains around 50 thousand
points in the cloud for a single pose for one individual, then the storage size
of the entire dataset will be in order of giga if not tera bytes. With these
motivations, this work introduces a new technique for 3D point clouds
generation using a neural modeling system to handle the differences caused by
heterogeneous depth cameras, and to generate a new face canonical compact
representation. The proposed system reduces the stored 3D dataset size, and if
required, provides an accurate dataset regeneration. Furthermore, the system
generates neural models for all gallery point clouds and stores these models to
represent the faces in the recognition or verification processes. For the probe
cloud to be verified, a new model is generated specifically for that particular
cloud and is matched against pre-stored gallery model presentations to identify
the query cloud. This work also introduces the utilization of Siamese deep
neural network in 3D face verification using generated model representations as

network is comparable all published results on Bosphorus dataset.","point,clouds,cloud",Artificial Intelligence

MGD-GAN: Text-to-Pedestrian generation through Multi-Grained Discrimination,"In this paper, we investigate the problem of text-to-pedestrian synthesis,
which has many potential applications in art, design, and video surveillance.
Existing methods for text-to-bird/flower synthesis are still far from solving
this fine-grained image generation problem, due to the complex structure and
heterogeneous appearance that the pedestrians naturally take on. To this end,
we propose the Multi-Grained Discrimination enhanced Generative Adversarial
Network, that capitalizes a human-part-based Discriminator (HPD) and a
self-cross-attended (SCA) global Discriminator in order to capture the
coherence of the complex body structure. A fined-grained word-level attention
mechanism is employed in the HPD module to enforce diversified appearance and
vivid details. In addition, two pedestrian generation metrics, named Pose Score
and Pose Variance, are devised to evaluate the generation quality and
diversity, respectively. We conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies
on the caption-annotated pedestrian dataset, CUHK Person Description Dataset.
The substantial improvement over the various metrics demonstrates the efficacy
of MGD-GAN on the text-to-pedestrian synthesis scenario.","synthesis,problem,design",Deep Learning
Minimizing FLOPs to Learn Efficient Sparse Representations,"Deep representation learning has become one of the most widely adopted
approaches for visual search, recommendation, and identification. Retrieval of
such representations from a large database is however computationally
challenging. Approximate methods based on learning compact representations,
have been widely explored for this problem, such as locality sensitive hashing,
product quantization, and PCA. In this work, in contrast to learning compact
representations, we propose to learn high dimensional and sparse
representations that have similar representational capacity as dense embeddings
while being more efficient due to sparse matrix multiplication operations which
can be much faster than dense multiplication. Following the key insight that
the number of operations decreases quadratically with the sparsity of
embeddings provided the non-zero entries are distributed uniformly across
dimensions, we propose a novel approach to learn such distributed sparse
embeddings via the use of a carefully constructed regularization function that
directly minimizes a continuous relaxation of the number of floating-point
operations (FLOPs) incurred during retrieval. Our experiments show that our
approach is competitive to the other baselines and yields a similar or better
speed-vs-accuracy tradeoff on practical datasets.","representations,recommendation,learning",Deep Learning

Implicit Deep Adaptive Design: Policy-Based Experimental Design without Likelihoods,"We introduce implicit Deep Adaptive Design (iDAD), a new method for
performing adaptive experiments in real-time with implicit models. iDAD
amortizes the cost of Bayesian optimal experimental design (BOED) by learning a
design policy network upfront, which can then be deployed quickly at the time
of the experiment. The iDAD network can be trained on any model which simulates
differentiable samples, unlike previous design policy work that requires a
closed form likelihood and conditionally independent experiments. At
deployment, iDAD allows design decisions to be made in milliseconds, in
contrast to traditional BOED approaches that require heavy computation during
the experiment itself. We illustrate the applicability of iDAD on a number of
experiments, and show that it provides a fast and effective mechanism for
performing adaptive design with implicit models.","Design,Deep,iDAD",Artificial Intelligence

A Divide-and-Conquer Approach towards Understanding Deep Networks,"Deep neural networks have achieved tremendous success in various fields
including medical image segmentation. However, they have long been criticized
for being a black-box, in that interpretation, understanding and correcting
architectures is difficult as there is no general theory for deep neural
network design. Previously, precision learning was proposed to fuse deep
architectures and traditional approaches. Deep networks constructed in this way
benefit from the original known operator, have fewer parameters, and improved
interpretability. However, they do not yield state-of-the-art performance in
all applications. In this paper, we propose to analyze deep networks using
known operators, by adopting a divide-and-conquer strategy to replace network
components, whilst retaining its performance. The task of retinal vessel
segmentation is investigated for this purpose. We start with a high-performance
U-Net and show by step-by-step conversion that we are able to divide the
network into modules of known operators. The results indicate that a
combination of a trainable guided filter and a trainable version of the Frangi
filter yields a performance at the level of U-Net (AUC 0.974 vs. 0.972) with a
tremendous reduction in parameters (111,536 vs. 9,575). In addition, the
trained layers can be mapped back into their original algorithmic
interpretation and analyzed using standard tools of signal processing.","Deep,neural,networks",Deep Learning
FaultNet: Faulty Rail-Valves Detection using Deep Learning and Computer Vision,"Regular inspection of rail valves and engines is an important task to ensure
the safety and efficiency of railway networks around the globe. Over the past
decade, computer vision and pattern recognition based techniques have gained
traction for such inspection and defect detection tasks. An automated
end-to-end trained system can potentially provide a low-cost, high throughput,
and cheap alternative to manual visual inspection of these components. However,
such systems require a huge amount of defective images for networks to
understand complex defects. In this paper, a multi-phase deep learning based
technique is proposed to perform accurate fault detection of rail-valves. Our
approach uses a two-step method to perform high precision image segmentation of
rail-valves resulting in pixel-wise accurate segmentation. Thereafter, a
computer vision technique is used to identify faulty valves. We demonstrate
that the proposed approach results in improved detection performance when
compared to current state-of-theart techniques used in fault detection.","inspection,detection,Regular",Machine Learning
A Study on Speech Enhancement Based on Diffusion Probabilistic Model,"Diffusion probabilistic models have demonstrated an outstanding capability to
model natural images and raw audio waveforms through a paired diffusion and
reverse processes. The unique property of the reverse process (namely,
eliminating non-target signals from the Gaussian noise and noisy signals) could
be utilized to restore clean signals. Based on this property, we propose a
diffusion probabilistic model-based speech enhancement (DiffuSE) model that
aims to recover clean speech signals from noisy signals. The fundamental
architecture of the proposed DiffuSE model is similar to that of DiffWave--a
high-quality audio waveform generation model that has a relatively low
computational cost and footprint. To attain better enhancement performance, we
designed an advanced reverse process, termed the supportive reverse process,
which adds noisy speech in each time-step to the predicted speech. The
experimental results show that DiffuSE yields performance that is comparable to
related audio generative models on the standardized Voice Bank corpus SE task.
Moreover, relative to the generally suggested full sampling schedule, the
proposed supportive reverse process especially improved the fast sampling,
taking few steps to yield better enhancement results over the conventional full
step inference process.","signals,reverse,process",Science

fields, a simple and effective method to aid receptive field selection in pose
estimation models based on optical flow inference. We contrast the performance
of a benchmark state-of-the-art model running on fixed receptive fields with
their adaptive field counterparts. By using a reduced receptive field, our
model can process slow-motion sequences (10x longer) 23% faster than the
benchmark model running at regular speed. The reduction in computational cost
is achieved while producing a pose prediction accuracy to within 0.36% of the

A Multi-view Multi-task Learning Framework for Multi-variate Time Series Forecasting,"Multi-variate time series (MTS) data is a ubiquitous class of data
abstraction in the real world. Any instance of MTS is generated from a hybrid
dynamical system and their specific dynamics are usually unknown. The hybrid
nature of such a dynamical system is a result of complex external attributes,
such as geographic location and time of day, each of which can be categorized
into either spatial attributes or temporal attributes. Therefore, there are two
fundamental views which can be used to analyze MTS data, namely the spatial
view and the temporal view. Moreover, from each of these two views, we can
partition the set of data samples of MTS into disjoint forecasting tasks in
accordance with their associated attribute values. Then, samples of the same
task will manifest similar forthcoming pattern, which is less sophisticated to
be predicted in comparison with the original single-view setting. Considering
this insight, we propose a novel multi-view multi-task (MVMT) learning
framework for MTS forecasting. Instead of being explicitly presented in most
scenarios, MVMT information is deeply concealed in the MTS data, which severely
hinders the model from capturing it naturally. To this end, we develop two
kinds of basic operations, namely task-wise affine transformation and task-wise
normalization, respectively. Applying these two operations with prior knowledge
on the spatial and temporal view allows the model to adaptively extract MVMT
information while predicting. Extensive experiments on three datasets are
conducted to illustrate that canonical architectures can be greatly enhanced by
the MVMT learning framework in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. In
addition, we design rich case studies to reveal the properties of
representations produced at different phases in the entire prediction
procedure.","MTS,data,MVMT",Deep Learning

Optimal Training of Fair Predictive Models,"Recently there has been sustained interest in modifying prediction algorithms
to satisfy fairness constraints. These constraints are typically complex
nonlinear functionals of the observed data distribution. Focusing on the causal
constraints proposed by Nabi and Shpitser (2018), we introduce new theoretical
results and optimization techniques to make model training easier and more
accurate. Specifically, we show how to reparameterize the observed data
likelihood such that fairness constraints correspond directly to parameters
that appear in the likelihood, transforming a complex constrained optimization
objective into a simple optimization problem with box constraints. We also
exploit methods from empirical likelihood theory in statistics to improve
predictive performance, without requiring parametric models for
high-dimensional feature vectors.","constraints,Recently,optimization",Artificial Intelligence
Approximating Spectral Clustering via Sampling: a Review,"Spectral clustering refers to a family of unsupervised learning algorithms
that compute a spectral embedding of the original data based on the
eigenvectors of a similarity graph. This non-linear transformation of the data
is both the key of these algorithms' success and their Achilles heel: forming a
graph and computing its dominant eigenvectors can indeed be computationally
prohibitive when dealing with more that a few tens of thousands of points. In
this paper, we review the principal research efforts aiming to reduce this
computational cost. We focus on methods that come with a theoretical control on
the clustering performance and incorporate some form of sampling in their
operation. Such methods abound in the machine learning, numerical linear
algebra, and graph signal processing literature and, amongst others, include
Nystr\""om-approximation, landmarks, coarsening, coresets, and compressive
spectral clustering. We present the approximation guarantees available for each
and discuss practical merits and limitations. Surprisingly, despite the breadth
of the literature explored, we conclude that there is still a gap between
theory and practice: the most scalable methods are only intuitively motivated
or loosely controlled, whereas those that come with end-to-end guarantees rely
on strong assumptions or enable a limited gain of computation time.","graph,data,eigenvectors",Machine Learning

Holographic Metasurface Antennas for Uplink Massive MIMO Systems,"We propose an uplink massive MIMO system using an array of holographic
metasurfaces as a sector antenna. The antenna consists of a set of rectangular
waveguide-fed metasurfaces combined along the elevation direction into a planar
aperture, each with subwavelength-sized metamaterial elements as radiators. The
metamaterial radiators are designed such that the waveguide-fed metasurface
implements a holographic solution for the guided (or reference) mode,
generating a fan beam towards a prescribed direction, thereby forming a
multibeam antenna system. We demonstrate that a narrowband uplink massive MIMO
system using the metasurfaces can achieve the sum capacity close to that
offered by the Rayleigh channel at 3.5 GHz. We show that metasurfaces
supporting multiple fan beams can achieve high spatial resolution in the
azimuth directions in sub-6 GHz channels, and thereby form uncorrelated MIMO
channels between the base station and users. Also, the proposed metasurface
antenna is structurally simple, low-cost, and efficient, and thus is suitable
to alleviate RF hardware issues common to massive MIMO systems equipped with a
large antenna system.","MIMO,antenna,system",
Fair Representation Learning using Interpolation Enabled Disentanglement,"With the growing interest in the machine learning community to solve
real-world problems, it has become crucial to uncover the hidden reasoning
behind their decisions by focusing on the fairness and auditing the predictions
made by these black-box models. In this paper, we propose a novel method to
address two key issues: (a) Can we simultaneously learn fair disentangled
representations while ensuring the utility of the learned representation for
downstream tasks, and (b)Can we provide theoretical insights into when the
proposed approach will be both fair and accurate. To address the former, we
propose the method FRIED, Fair Representation learning using Interpolation
Enabled Disentanglement. In our architecture, by imposing a critic-based
adversarial framework, we enforce the interpolated points in the latent space
to be more realistic. This helps in capturing the data manifold effectively and
enhances the utility of the learned representation for downstream prediction
tasks. We address the latter question by developing a theory on
fairness-accuracy trade-offs using classifier-based conditional mutual
information estimation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FRIED on datasets
of different modalities - tabular, text, and image datasets. We observe that
the representations learned by FRIED are overall fairer in comparison to
existing baselines and also accurate for downstream prediction tasks.
Additionally, we evaluate FRIED on a real-world healthcare claims dataset where
we conduct an expert aided model auditing study providing useful insights into
opioid ad-diction patterns.","FRIED,fair,representation",
Do Not Forget to Attend to Uncertainty while Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting,"One of the major limitations of deep learning models is that they face

several approaches proposed to tackle the problem of incremental learning. Most

self-attention framework to address the incremental learning problem. We define
distillation losses in terms of aleatoric uncertainty and self-attention. In
the proposed work, we investigate different ablation analyses on these losses.

"Making Reads in BFT State Machine Replication Fast, Linearizable, and Live","Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) is a seminal state machine
replication protocol that achieves a performance comparable to non-replicated
systems in realistic environments. A reason for such high performance is the
set of optimizations introduced in the protocol. One of these optimizations is
read-only requests, a particular type of client request which avoids running
the three-step agreement protocol and allows replicas to respond directly, thus
reducing the latency of reads from five to two communication steps. Given
PBFT's broad influence, its design and optimizations influenced many BFT
protocols and systems that followed, e.g., BFT-SMaRt. We show, for the first
time, that the read-only request optimization introduced in PBFT more than 20
years ago can violate its liveness. Notably, the problem affects not only the
optimized read-only operations but also standard, totally-ordered operations.
We show this weakness by presenting an attack in which a malicious leader
blocks correct clients and present two solutions for patching the protocol,
making read-only operations fast and correct. The two solutions were
implemented on BFT-SMaRt and evaluated in different scenarios, showing their
effectiveness in preventing the identified attack.","Tolerance,Byzantine,Fault",

A study on the use of Boundary Equilibrium GAN for Approximate Frontalization of Unconstrained Faces to aid in Surveillance,"Face frontalization is the process of synthesizing frontal facing views of
faces given its angled poses. We implement a generative adversarial network
(GAN) with spherical linear interpolation (Slerp) for frontalization of
unconstrained facial images. Our special focus is intended towards the
generation of approximate frontal faces of the side posed images captured from
surveillance cameras. Specifically, the present work is a comprehensive study
on the implementation of an auto-encoder based Boundary Equilibrium GAN (BEGAN)
to generate frontal faces using an interpolation of a side view face and its
mirrored view. To increase the quality of the interpolated output we implement
a BEGAN with Slerp. This approach could produce a promising output along with a
faster and more stable training for the model. The BEGAN model additionally has
a balanced generator-discriminator combination, which prevents mode collapse
along with a global convergence measure. It is expected that such an
approximate face generation model would be able to replace face composites used
in surveillance and crime detection.","BEGAN,GAN,Face",

Self-learned Intelligence for Integrated Decision and Control of Automated Vehicles at Signalized Intersections,"Intersection is one of the most complex and accident-prone urban scenarios
for autonomous driving wherein making safe and computationally efficient
decisions is non-trivial. Current research mainly focuses on the simplified
traffic conditions while ignoring the existence of mixed traffic flows, i.e.,
vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians. For urban roads, different participants
leads to a quite dynamic and complex interaction, posing great difficulty to
learn an intelligent policy. This paper develops the dynamic permutation state
representation in the framework of integrated decision and control (IDC) to
handle signalized intersections with mixed traffic flows. Specially, this
representation introduces an encoding function and summation operator to
construct driving states from environmental observation, capable of dealing
with different types and variant number of traffic participants. A constrained
optimal control problem is built wherein the objective involves tracking
performance and the constraints for different participants and signal lights
are designed respectively to assure safety. We solve this problem by offline
optimizing encoding function, value function and policy function, wherein the
reasonable state representation will be given by the encoding function and then
served as the input of policy and value function. An off-policy training is
designed to reuse observations from driving environment and backpropagation
through time is utilized to update the policy function and encoding function
jointly. Verification result shows that the dynamic permutation state
representation can enhance the driving performance of IDC, including comfort,
decision compliance and safety with a large margin. The trained driving policy
can realize efficient and smooth passing in the complex intersection,
guaranteeing driving intelligence and safety simultaneously.","function,driving,policy",

Joint marginal structural models to estimate the causal effects of multiple longitudinal treatments in continuous time with application to COVID-19,"To draw real-world evidence about the comparative effectiveness of complex
time-varying treatment regimens on patient survival, we develop a joint
marginal structural proportional hazards model and novel weighting schemes in
continuous time to account for time-varying confounding and censoring. Our
methods formulate complex longitudinal treatments with multiple ""start/stop""
switches as the recurrent events with discontinuous intervals of treatment
eligibility. We derive the weights in continuous time to handle a complex
longitudinal dataset on its own terms, without the need to discretize or
artificially align the measurement times. We further propose using machine
learning models designed for censored survival data with time-varying
covariates and the kernel function estimator of the baseline intensity to
efficiently estimate the continuous-time weights. Our simulations demonstrate
that the proposed methods provide better bias reduction and nominal coverage
probability when analyzing observational longitudinal survival data with
irregularly spaced time intervals, compared to conventional methods that
require aligned measurement time points. We apply the proposed methods to a
large-scale COVID-19 dataset to estimate the causal effects of several COVID-19
treatment strategies on in-hospital mortality or ICU admission, and provide new
insights relative to findings from randomized trials.","time,complex,treatment",
Optimal Precoder Design for MIMO-OFDM-based Joint Automotive Radar-Communication Networks,"Large-scale deployment of connected vehicles with cooperative awareness
technologies increases the demand for vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication
spectrum in 5.9 GHz that is mainly allocated for the exchange of safety
messages. To supplement V2X communication and support the high data rates
needed by broadband applications, the millimeter-wave (mmWave) automotive radar
spectrum at 76-81 GHz can be utilized. For this purpose, joint
radar-communication systems have been proposed in the literature to perform
both functions using the same waveform and hardware. While multiple-input and
multiple-output (MIMO) communication with multiple users enables independent
data streaming for high throughput, MIMO radar processing provides
high-resolution imaging that is crucial for safety-critical systems. However,
employing conventional precoding methods designed for communication generates
directional beams that impair MIMO radar imaging and target tracking
capabilities during data streaming. In this paper, we propose a MIMO joint
automotive radar-communication (JARC) framework based on orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform. First, we show that the MIMO-OFDM
preamble can be exploited for both MIMO radar processing and estimation of the
communication channel. Then, we propose an optimal precoder design method that
enables high accuracy target tracking while transmitting independent data
streams to multiple receivers. The proposed methods provide high-resolution
radar imaging and high throughput capabilities for MIMO JARC networks. Finally,
we evaluate the efficacy of the proposed methods through numerical simulations.","MIMO,radar,communication",
Few-shot Learning for Time-series Forecasting,"Time-series forecasting is important for many applications. Forecasting
models are usually trained using time-series data in a specific target task.
However, sufficient data in the target task might be unavailable, which leads
to performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a few-shot learning
method that forecasts a future value of a time-series in a target task given a
few time-series in the target task. Our model is trained using time-series data
in multiple training tasks that are different from target tasks. Our model uses
a few time-series to build a forecasting function based on a recurrent neural
network with an attention mechanism. With the attention mechanism, we can
retrieve useful patterns in a small number of time-series for the current
situation. Our model is trained by minimizing an expected test error of
forecasting next timestep values. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method using 90 time-series datasets.","Time-series,target,task",
Stealing Black-Box Functionality Using The Deep Neural Tree Architecture,"This paper makes a substantial step towards cloning the functionality of
black-box models by introducing a Machine learning (ML) architecture named Deep
Neural Trees (DNTs). This new architecture can learn to separate different
tasks of the black-box model, and clone its task-specific behavior. We propose
to train the DNT using an active learning algorithm to obtain faster and more
sample-efficient training. In contrast to prior work, we study a complex
""victim"" black-box model based solely on input-output interactions, while at
the same time the attacker and the victim model may have completely different
internal architectures. The attacker is a ML based algorithm whereas the victim
is a generally unknown module, such as a multi-purpose digital chip, complex
analog circuit, mechanical system, software logic or a hybrid of these. The
trained DNT module not only can function as the attacked module, but also
provides some level of explainability to the cloned model due to the tree-like
nature of the proposed architecture.","Deep,Machine,model",

representation learning for multivariate time series, with techniques for deep
anomaly detection originally developed for computer vision that we tailor to
the time series setting. Our window-based approach facilitates learning the
boundary between normal and anomalous classes by injecting generic synthetic
anomalies into the available data. Moreover, our method can effectively take
advantage of all the available information, be it as domain knowledge, or as
training labels in the semi-supervised setting. We demonstrate empirically on
standard benchmark datasets that our approach obtains a state-of-the-art
performance in these settings.","time,NCAD,series",

either gradually varying volatility, presence of change points, or a
combination thereof. We evaluate the model on synthetic and real-world time

Potential-Based Shaping and Q-Value Initialization are Equivalent,"Shaping has proven to be a powerful but precarious means of improving
reinforcement learning performance. Ng, Harada, and Russell (1999) proposed the
potential-based shaping algorithm for adding shaping rewards in a way that
guarantees the learner will learn optimal behavior. In this note, we prove
certain similarities between this shaping algorithm and the initialization step
required for several reinforcement learning algorithms. More specifically, we
prove that a reinforcement learner with initial Q-values based on the shaping
algorithm's potential function make the same updates throughout learning as a
learner receiving potential-based shaping rewards. We further prove that under
a broad category of policies, the behavior of these two learners are
indistinguishable. The comparison provides intuition on the theoretical
properties of the shaping algorithm as well as a suggestion for a simpler
method for capturing the algorithm's benefit. In addition, the equivalence
raises previously unaddressed issues concerning the efficiency of learning with
potential-based shaping.","Shaping,algorithm,learning",

Joint Search of Optimal Topology and Trajectory for Planar Linkages,"We present an algorithm to compute planar linkage topology and geometry,
given a user-specified end-effector trajectory. Planar linkage structures
convert rotational or prismatic motions of a single actuator into an
arbitrarily complex periodic motion, \refined{which is an important component
when building low-cost, modular robots, mechanical toys, and foldable

numerical optimization with quadratic objective functions and non-convex
quadratic constraints involving mixed-integer decision variables (MIQCQP). We
propose and compare three approximate algorithms to solve this problem:
mixed-integer conic-programming (MICP), mixed-integer nonlinear programming
(MINLP), and simulated annealing (SA). We evaluated these algorithms searching
for planar linkages involving $10-14$ rigid links. Our results show that the
best performance can be achieved by combining MICP and MINLP, leading to a
hybrid algorithm capable of finding the planar linkages within a couple of
hours on a desktop machine, which significantly outperforms the SA baseline in
terms of optimality. We highlight the effectiveness of our optimized planar
linkages by using them as legs of a walking robot.","planar,structures,linkages",
Asymptotically Efficient Off-Policy Evaluation for Tabular Reinforcement Learning,"We consider the problem of off-policy evaluation for reinforcement learning,
where the goal is to estimate the expected reward of a target policy $\pi$
using offline data collected by running a logging policy $\mu$. Standard
importance-sampling based approaches for this problem suffer from a variance
that scales exponentially with time horizon $H$, which motivates a splurge of
recent interest in alternatives that break the ""Curse of Horizon"" (Liu et al.
2018, Xie et al. 2019). In particular, it was shown that a marginalized
importance sampling (MIS) approach can be used to achieve an estimation error
of order $O(H^3/ n)$ in mean square error (MSE) under an episodic Markov
Decision Process model with finite states and potentially infinite actions. The
MSE bound however is still a factor of $H$ away from a Cramer-Rao lower bound
of order $\Omega(H^2/n)$. In this paper, we prove that with a simple
modification to the MIS estimator, we can asymptotically attain the Cramer-Rao
lower bound, provided that the action space is finite. We also provide a
general method for constructing MIS estimators with high-probability error
bounds.","policy,MIS,horizon",

PhiNets: a scalable backbone for low-power AI at the edge,"In the Internet of Things era, where we see many interconnected and

artificial intelligence algorithms to peripheral devices, such as the end-nodes

innovative methods. In this work, we present PhiNets, a new scalable backbone

Learning to Steer by Mimicking Features from Heterogeneous Auxiliary Networks,"The training of many existing end-to-end steering angle prediction models
heavily relies on steering angles as the supervisory signal. Without learning
from much richer contexts, these methods are susceptible to the presence of
sharp road curves, challenging traffic conditions, strong shadows, and severe
lighting changes. In this paper, we considerably improve the accuracy and
robustness of predictions through heterogeneous auxiliary networks feature
mimicking, a new and effective training method that provides us with much
richer contextual signals apart from steering direction. Specifically, we train
our steering angle predictive model by distilling multi-layer knowledge from
multiple heterogeneous auxiliary networks that perform related but different
tasks, e.g., image segmentation or optical flow estimation. As opposed to
multi-task learning, our method does not require expensive annotations of
related tasks on the target set. This is made possible by applying contemporary
off-the-shelf networks on the target set and mimicking their features in
different layers after transformation. The auxiliary networks are discarded
after training without affecting the runtime efficiency of our model. Our
approach achieves a new state-of-the-art on Udacity and Comma.ai, outperforming
the previous best by a large margin of 12.8% and 52.1%, respectively.

Interventional Sum-Product Networks: Causal Inference with Tractable Probabilistic Models,"While probabilistic models are an important tool for studying causality,

gate functions, e.g., neural networks. Providing an arbitrarily intervened
causal graph as input, effectively subsuming Pearl's do-operator, the gate
function predicts the parameters of the SPN. The resulting interventional SPNs
are motivated and illustrated by a structural causal model themed around
personal health. Our empirical evaluation on three benchmark data sets as well
as a synthetic health data set clearly demonstrates that interventional SPNs
indeed are both expressive in modelling and flexible in adapting to the

Artificial Intelligence in the Global South (AI4D): Potential and Risks,"Artificial intelligence is becoming more widely available in all parts of the

Recent Developments in Inference: Practicalities for Applied Economics,"We provide a review of recent developments in the calculation of standard
errors and test statistics for statistical inference. While much of the focus
of the last two decades in economics has been on generating unbiased
coefficients, recent years has seen a variety of advancements in correcting for
non-standard standard errors. We synthesize these recent advances in addressing
challenges to conventional inference, like heteroskedasticity, clustering,
serial correlation, and testing multiple hypotheses. We also discuss recent
advancements in numerical methods, such as the bootstrap, wild bootstrap, and
randomization inference. We make three specific recommendations. First, applied
economists need to clearly articulate the challenges to statistical inference
that are present in data as well as the source of those challenges. Second,
modern computing power and statistical software means that applied economists
have no excuse for not correctly calculating their standard errors and test
statistics. Third, because complicated sampling strategies and research designs
make it difficult to work out the correct formula for standard errors and test
statistics, we believe that in the applied economics profession it should
become standard practice to rely on asymptotic refinements to the distribution
of an estimator or test statistic via bootstrapping. Throughout, we reference
built-in and user-written Stata commands that allow one to quickly calculate
accurate standard errors and relevant test statistics.","errors,standard,test",

Stochastically Dominant Distributional Reinforcement Learning,"We describe a new approach for managing aleatoric uncertainty in the
Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigm. Instead of selecting actions according to
a single statistic, we propose a distributional method based on the
second-order stochastic dominance (SSD) relation. This compares the inherent
dispersion of random returns induced by actions, producing a more comprehensive
and robust evaluation of the environment's uncertainty. The necessary
conditions for SSD require estimators to predict accurate second moments. To
accommodate this, we map the distributional RL problem to a Wasserstein
gradient flow, treating the distributional Bellman residual as a potential
energy functional. We propose a particle-based algorithm for which we prove
optimality and convergence. Our experiments characterize the algorithm
performance and demonstrate how uncertainty and performance are better balanced

Prolegomena To Any Future Device Physics,"For the last 60 years, advances in conventional computing platforms have been
driven by the empirical notion known as Moores law. In its essence, Moores law
is a ubiquitous description of the exponential increase in transistor density

started as an interesting observation, it has evolved into a self-fulfilling
prophecy used to drive the entire semiconductor industry. Arguments for or
against the end of Moores law have proliferated and the reluctant consensus is
that Moores law will disappear. Warnings of the end of this trend have been
repeatedly thwarted by advances in many different aspects of the computing
ecosystem including materials improvements, device design, device or circuit
cleverness, and software and architectural innovations. While many have argued
the impending doom of Moores law is the ultimate roadblock imposed by atomic
length scales, quantum processes, and energy consumption limits, we contend
that Moores law must be jettisoned for a different reason: Words matter. Even
those who adamantly declare the end of Moores law still use the language of
Moores law. The inward focus of this notion imposes an intellectual tyranny
that inhibits revolutionary progress. We suggest instead a more outwardly
focused perspective and suggest a shift in language to a regime we coin the
Feynman Mandate. In this perspective, we outline the issues with the continued
use of Moores law as well as a prescription of transitioning to a new lexicon.
We outline a new, more general metric for ascertaining progress and identify
the roles of various stakeholders in this process.","Moores,law,computing",
Semi-supervised learning based on generative adversarial network: a comparison between good GAN and bad GAN approach,"Recently, semi-supervised learning methods based on generative adversarial
networks (GANs) have received much attention. Among them, two distinct
approaches have achieved competitive results on a variety of benchmark
datasets. Bad GAN learns a classifier with unrealistic samples distributed on
the complement of the support of the input data. Conversely, Triple GAN
consists of a three-player game that tries to leverage good generated samples
to boost classification results. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive
comparison of these two approaches on different benchmark datasets. We
demonstrate their different properties on image generation, and sensitivity to
the amount of labeled data provided. By comprehensively comparing these two
methods, we hope to shed light on the future of GAN-based semi-supervised
learning.","Recently,networks,attention",
Design and Evaluate Recomposited OR-AND-XOR-PUF,"Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) is a hardware security primitive with a
desirable feature of low-cost. Based on the space of challenge-response pairs
(CRPs), it has two categories:weak PUF and strong PUF. Though designing a
reliable and secure lightweight strong PUF is challenging, there is continuing
efforts to fulfill this gap due to wide range of applications enabled by strong
PUF. It was prospected that the combination of MAX and MIN bit-wise operation
is promising for improving the modeling resilience when MAX and MIN are
employed in the PUF recomposition. The main rationale lies on the fact that
each bit-wise might be mainly vulnerable to one specific type of modeling
attack, combining them can have an improved holistic resilience. This work is
to first evaluate the main PUF performance, in particular,uniformity and
reliability of the OR-AND-XOR-PUF(OAX-PUF)-(x, y, z)-OAX-PUF. Compared with the
most used l-XOR-PUF, the (x, y, z)-OAX-PUF eventually exhibits better
reliability given l=x+y+z without degrading the uniformity retaining to be 50%.
We further examine the modeling resilience of the (x, y, z)-OAX-PUF with four
powerful attacking strategies to date, which are Logistic Regression (LR)
attack, reliability assisted CMA-ES attack, multilayer perceptron (MLP) attack,
and the most recent hybrid LR-reliability attack. In comparison with the
XOR-APUF, the OAX-APUF successfully defeats the CAM-ES attack. However, it
shows no notable modeling accuracy drop against other three attacks, though the
attacking times have been greatly prolonged to LR and hybrid LR-reliability
attacks. Overall, the OAX recomposition could be an alternative lightweight
recomposition method compared to XOR towards constructing strong PUFs if the
underlying PUF, e.g., FF-APUF, has exhibited improved resilience to modeling
attack, because the OAX incurs smaller reliability degradation compared to XOR.","PUF,attack,Function",
smol: Sensing Soil Moisture using LoRa,"Technologies for environmental and agricultural monitoring are on the rise,
however, there is a lack of small, low-power, and lowcost sensing devices in
the industry. One of these monitoring tools is a soil moisture sensor. Soil
moisture has significant effects on crop health and yield, but commercial
monitors are very expensive, require manual use, or constant attention. This
calls for a simple and low-cost solution based on novel technology. In this
work, we introduce smol: Sensing Soil Moisture using LoRa, a low-cost system to
measure soil moisture using received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and
transmission power. It is compact and can be deployed in the field to collect
data automatically with little manual intervention. Our design is enabled by
the phenomenon that soil moisture attenuates wireless signals, so the signal
strength between a transmitter-receiver pair decreases. We exploit this
physical property to determine the variation in soil moisture. We designed and
tested our measurement-based prototype in both indoor and outdoor environments.
With proper regression calibration, we show soil moisture can be predicted
using LoRa parameters.","moisture,soil,low-power",
ConceptLearner: Discovering Visual Concepts from Weakly Labeled Image Collections,"Discovering visual knowledge from weakly labeled data is crucial to scale up
computer vision recognition system, since it is expensive to obtain fully
labeled data for a large number of concept categories. In this paper, we
propose ConceptLearner, which is a scalable approach to discover visual
concepts from weakly labeled image collections. Thousands of visual concept
detectors are learned automatically, without human in the loop for additional
annotation. We show that these learned detectors could be applied to recognize
concepts at image-level and to detect concepts at image region-level
accurately. Under domain-specific supervision, we further evaluate the learned
concepts for scene recognition on SUN database and for object detection on
Pascal VOC 2007. ConceptLearner shows promising performance compared to fully
supervised and weakly supervised methods.","data,labeled,weakly",

Subspace Clustering using Ensembles of $K$-Subspaces,"Subspace clustering is the unsupervised grouping of points lying near a union
of low-dimensional linear subspaces. Algorithms based directly on geometric
properties of such data tend to either provide poor empirical performance, lack
theoretical guarantees, or depend heavily on their initialization. We present a
novel geometric approach to the subspace clustering problem that leverages
ensembles of the K-subspaces (KSS) algorithm via the evidence accumulation
clustering framework. Our algorithm, referred to as ensemble K-subspaces
(EKSS), forms a co-association matrix whose (i,j)th entry is the number of
times points i and j are clustered together by several runs of KSS with random
initializations. We prove general recovery guarantees for any algorithm that
forms an affinity matrix with entries close to a monotonic transformation of
pairwise absolute inner products. We then show that a specific instance of EKSS
results in an affinity matrix with entries of this form, and hence our proposed
algorithm can provably recover subspaces under similar conditions to
state-of-the-art algorithms. The finding is, to the best of our knowledge, the
first recovery guarantee for evidence accumulation clustering and for KSS
variants. We show on synthetic data that our method performs well in the
traditionally challenging settings of subspaces with large intersection,
subspaces with small principal angles, and noisy data. Finally, we evaluate our
algorithm on six common benchmark datasets and show that unlike existing
methods, EKSS achieves excellent empirical performance when there are both a
small and large number of points per subspace.","algorithm,KSS,clustering",
Differentiable Augmentation for Data-Efficient GAN Training,"The performance of generative adversarial networks (GANs) heavily
deteriorates given a limited amount of training data. This is mainly because
the discriminator is memorizing the exact training set. To combat it, we
propose Differentiable Augmentation (DiffAugment), a simple method that
improves the data efficiency of GANs by imposing various types of
differentiable augmentations on both real and fake samples. Previous attempts
to directly augment the training data manipulate the distribution of real
images, yielding little benefit; DiffAugment enables us to adopt the
differentiable augmentation for the generated samples, effectively stabilizes
training, and leads to better convergence. Experiments demonstrate consistent
gains of our method over a variety of GAN architectures and loss functions for
both unconditional and class-conditional generation. With DiffAugment, we
achieve a state-of-the-art FID of 6.80 with an IS of 100.8 on ImageNet 128x128
and 2-4x reductions of FID given 1,000 images on FFHQ and LSUN. Furthermore,
with only 20% training data, we can match the top performance on CIFAR-10 and
CIFAR-100. Finally, our method can generate high-fidelity images using only 100
images without pre-training, while being on par with existing transfer learning
algorithms. Code is available at

Context Forest for efficient object detection with large mixture models,"We present Context Forest (ConF), a technique for predicting properties of
the objects in an image based on its global appearance. Compared to standard
nearest-neighbour techniques, ConF is more accurate, fast and memory efficient.
We train ConF to predict which aspects of an object class are likely to appear
in a given image (e.g. which viewpoint). This enables to speed-up
multi-component object detectors, by automatically selecting the most relevant
components to run on that image. This is particularly useful for detectors
trained from large datasets, which typically need many components to fully
absorb the data and reach their peak performance. ConF provides a speed-up of
2x for the DPM detector [1] and of 10x for the EE-SVM detector [2]. To show
ConF's generality, we also train it to predict at which locations objects are
likely to appear in an image. Incorporating this information in the detector
score improves mAP performance by about 2% by removing false positive
detections in unlikely locations.","Forest,Context,ConF",

The Projection Extension Method: A Spectrally Accurate Technique for Complex Domains,"An essential ingredient of a spectral method is the choice of suitable bases
for test and trial spaces. On complex domains, these bases are harder to
devise, necessitating the use of domain partitioning techniques such as the
spectral element method. In this study, we introduce the Projection Extension
(PE) method, an approach that yields spectrally accurate solutions to various
problems on complex geometries without requiring domain decomposition. This
technique builds on the insights used by extension methodologies such as the
immersed boundary smooth extension and Smooth Forcing Extension (SFE) methods
that are designed to improve the order of accuracy of the immersed boundary
method. In particular, it couples an accurate extension procedure, that
functions on arbitrary domains regardless of connectedness or regularity, with
a least squares minimization of the boundary conditions. The resulting
procedure is stable under iterative application and straightforward to
generalize to higher dimensions. Moreover, it rapidly and robustly yields
exponentially convergent solutions to a number of challenging test problems,
including elliptic, parabolic, Newtonian fluid flow, and viscoelastic problems.","Extension,method,spectral",

Inter-choice dependent super-network weights,"The automatic design of architectures for neural networks, Neural

the thereby created networks repeatedly broke state-of-the-art results for
several disciplines. The network search spaces are often finite and designed by
hand, in a way that a fixed and small number of decisions constitute a specific
architecture. Given these circumstances, inter-choice dependencies are likely
to exist and affect the network search, but are unaccounted for in the popular
one-shot methods. We extend the Single-Path One-Shot search-networks with
additional weights that depend on combinations of choices and analyze their
effect. Experiments in NAS-Bench 201 and SubImageNet based search spaces show
an improved super-network performance in only-convolutions settings and that
the overhead is nearly negligible for sequential network designs.","neural,Search,network",

On Improving Adversarial Transferability of Vision Transformers,"Vision transformers (ViTs) process input images as sequences of patches via
self-attention; a radically different architecture than convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). This makes it interesting to study the adversarial feature
space of ViT models and their transferability. In particular, we observe that
adversarial patterns found via conventional adversarial attacks show very low
black-box transferability even for large ViT models. However, we show that this
phenomenon is only due to the sub-optimal attack procedures that do not
leverage the true representation potential of ViTs. A deep ViT is composed of
multiple blocks, with a consistent architecture comprising of self-attention
and feed-forward layers, where each block is capable of independently producing
a class token. Formulating an attack using only the last class token
(conventional approach) does not directly leverage the discriminative
information stored in the earlier tokens, leading to poor adversarial
transferability of ViTs. Using the compositional nature of ViT models, we
enhance the transferability of existing attacks by introducing two novel
strategies specific to the architecture of ViT models. (i) Self-Ensemble: We
propose a method to find multiple discriminative pathways by dissecting a
single ViT model into an ensemble of networks. This allows explicitly utilizing
class-specific information at each ViT block. (ii) Token Refinement: We then
propose to refine the tokens to further enhance the discriminative capacity at
each block of ViT. Our token refinement systematically combines the class
tokens with structural information preserved within the patch tokens. An
adversarial attack, when applied to such refined tokens within the ensemble of
classifiers found in a single vision transformer, has significantly higher
transferability.","ViT,adversarial,transferability",
Beyond Robustness: A Taxonomy of Approaches towards Resilient Multi-Robot Systems,"Robustness is key to engineering, automation, and science as a whole.
However, the property of robustness is often underpinned by costly requirements
such as over-provisioning, known uncertainty and predictive models, and known
adversaries. These conditions are idealistic, and often not satisfiable.
Resilience on the other hand is the capability to endure unexpected
disruptions, to recover swiftly from negative events, and bounce back to
normality. In this survey article, we analyze how resilience is achieved in
networks of agents and multi-robot systems that are able to overcome adversity
by leveraging system-wide complementarity, diversity, and redundancy - often
involving a reconfiguration of robotic capabilities to provide some key ability
that was not present in the system a priori. As society increasingly depends on
connected automated systems to provide key infrastructure services (e.g.,
logistics, transport, and precision agriculture), providing the means to
achieving resilient multi-robot systems is paramount. By enumerating the
consequences of a system that is not resilient (fragile), we argue that
resilience must become a central engineering design consideration. Towards this
goal, the community needs to gain clarity on how it is defined, measured, and
maintained. We address these questions across foundational robotics domains,
spanning perception, control, planning, and learning. One of our key
contributions is a formal taxonomy of approaches, which also helps us discuss
the defining factors and stressors for a resilient system. Finally, this survey
article gives insight as to how resilience may be achieved. Importantly, we
highlight open problems that remain to be tackled in order to reap the benefits
of resilient robotic systems.","Resilience,systems,key",

Variability of electron and hole spin qubits due to interface roughness and charge traps,"Semiconductor spin qubits may show significant device-to-device variability
in the presence of spin-orbit coupling mechanisms. Interface roughness, charge
traps, layout or process inhomogeneities indeed shape the real space wave
functions, hence the spin properties. It is, therefore, important to understand
how reproducible the qubits can be, in order to assess strategies to cope with
variability, and to set constraints on the quality of materials and
fabrication. Here we model the variability of single qubit properties (Larmor
and Rabi frequencies) due to disorder at the Si/SiO$_2$ interface (roughness,
charge traps) in metal-oxide-semiconductor devices. We consider both electron
qubits (with synthetic spin-orbit coupling fields created by micro-magnets) and
hole qubits (with intrinsic spin-orbit coupling). We show that charge traps are
much more limiting than interface roughness, and can scatter Rabi frequencies
over one order of magnitude. We discuss the implications for the design of spin
qubits and for the choice of materials.","qubits,spin,roughness",

A model of systems with modes and mode transitions,"We propose a method of classifying the operation of a system into finitely
many modes. Each mode has its own objectives for the system's behaviour and its
own mathematical models and algorithms designed to accomplish its objectives. A
central problem is deciding when to transition from one mode to some other
mode, a decision that may be contested and involve partial or inconsistent
information or evidence. We model formally the concept of modes for a system
and derive a family of data types for analysing mode transitions. The data
types are simplicial complexes, both abstract and realised in euclidean space
$\mathbb{R}^{n}$. In the data type, a mode is represented by a simplex. Each
state of a system can be evaluated relative to different modes by mapping it
into one or more simplices. This calibration measures the extent to which
distinct modes are appropriate for the state and can decide on a transition. We
explain this methodology based on modes, introduce the mathematical ideas about
simplicial objects we need and use them to build a theoretical framework for
modes and mode transitions. To illustrate the general model in some detail, we
work though a case study of an autonomous racing car.","modes,mode,system",
Thumbnail: A Novel Data Augmentation for Convolutional Neural Network,"In this paper, we propose a new data augmentation strategy named Thumbnail,

thumbnail, and pasting it in the random position of the original image. The
generated image not only retains most of the original image information but
also has the global information in the thumbnail. Furthermore, we find that the
idea of thumbnail can be perfectly integrated with Mixed Sample Data
Augmentation, so we paste the thumbnail in another image where the ground truth
labels are also mixed with a certain weight, which makes great achievements on
various computer vision tasks. Extensive experiments show that Thumbnail works
better than the state-of-the-art augmentation strategies across classification,
fine-grained image classification, and object detection. On ImageNet
classification, ResNet50 architecture with our method achieves 79.21% accuracy,
which is more than 2.89% improvement on the baseline.","Thumbnail,image,data",

Graph Neural Network with Automorphic Equivalence Filters,"Graph neural network (GNN) has recently been established as an effective

gives rise to the concerns about their representational power. Here, we
introduce the concept of automorphic equivalence to theoretically analyze GNN's
expressiveness in differentiating node's structural role. We show that the
existing message passing GNNs have limitations in learning expressive
representations. Moreover, we design a novel GNN class that leverages learnable
automorphic equivalence filters to explicitly differentiate the structural
roles of each node's neighbors, and uses a squeeze-and-excitation module to
fuse various structural information. We theoretically prove that the proposed
model is expressive in terms of generating distinct representations for nodes
with different structural feature. Besides, we empirically validate our model
on eight real-world graph data, including social network, e-commerce

Using Synthetic Images To Uncover Population Biases In Facial Landmarks Detection,"In order to analyze a trained model performance and identify its weak spots,
one has to set aside a portion of the data for testing. The test set has to be
large enough to detect statistically significant biases with respect to all the
relevant sub-groups in the target population. This requirement may be difficult
to satisfy, especially in data-hungry applications. We propose to overcome this
difficulty by generating synthetic test set. We use the face landmarks
detection task to validate our proposal by showing that all the biases observed
on real datasets are also seen on a carefully designed synthetic dataset. This
shows that synthetic test sets can efficiently detect a model's weak spots and
overcome limitations of real test set in terms of quantity and/or diversity.","test,set,testing",

Event-triggered Control for Nonlinear Systems with Center Manifolds,"In this work, we consider the problem of event-triggered implementation of
control laws designed for the local stabilization of nonlinear systems with
center manifolds. We propose event-triggering conditions which are derived from
a local input-to-state stability characterization of such systems. The
triggering conditions ensure local ultimate boundedness of the trajectories and
the existence of a uniform positive lower bound for the inter-event times. The
ultimate bound can be made arbitrarily small, but by allowing for smaller
inter-event times. Under certain assumptions on the controller structure, local
asymptotic stability of the origin is also guaranteed. Two sets of triggering
conditions are proposed, that cater to the cases where the exact center
manifold and only an approximation of the center manifold is computable. The
closed-loop system exhibits some desirable properties when the exact knowledge
of the center manifold is employed in checking the triggering conditions. Three
illustrative examples that explore different scenarios are presented and the
applicability of the proposed methods is demonstrated. The third example
concerns the event-triggered implementation of a position stabilizing
controller for the open-loop unstable Mobile Inverted Pendulum (MIP) robot.","local,conditions,center",
Setting up a Reinforcement Learning Task with a Real-World Robot,"Reinforcement learning is a promising approach to developing hard-to-engineer
adaptive solutions for complex and diverse robotic tasks. However, learning
with real-world robots is often unreliable and difficult, which resulted in
their low adoption in reinforcement learning research. This difficulty is
worsened by the lack of guidelines for setting up learning tasks with robots.
In this work, we develop a learning task with a UR5 robotic arm to bring to
light some key elements of a task setup and study their contributions to the
challenges with robots. We find that learning performance can be highly
sensitive to the setup, and thus oversights and omissions in setup details can
make effective learning, reproducibility, and fair comparison hard. Our study
suggests some mitigating steps to help future experimenters avoid difficulties
and pitfalls. We show that highly reliable and repeatable experiments can be
performed in our setup, indicating the possibility of reinforcement learning
research extensively based on real-world robots.","learning,Reinforcement,robots",

Sparse regularization with a non-convex penalty for SAR imaging and autofocusing,"In this paper, SAR image reconstruction with joint phase error estimation
(autofocusing) is formulated as an inverse problem. An optimization model
utilising a sparsity-enforcing Cauchy regularizer is proposed, and an
alternating minimization framework is used to solve it, in which the desired
image and the phase errors are optimized alternatively. For the image
reconstruction sub-problem (f-sub-problem), two methods are presented capable
of handling the problem's complex nature, and we thus present two variants of
our SAR image autofocusing algorithm. Firstly, we design a complex version of
the forward-backward splitting algorithm (CFBA) to solve the f-sub-problem
iteratively. For the second variant, the Wirtinger alternating minimization
autofocusing (WAMA) method is presented, in which techniques of Wirtinger
calculus are utilized to minimize the complex-valued cost function in the
f-sub-problem in a direct fashion. For both methods, the phase error estimation
sub-problem is solved by simply expanding and observing its cost function.
Moreover, the convergence of both algorithms is discussed in detail. By
conducting experiments on both simulated scenes and real SAR images, the
proposed method is demonstrated to give impressive autofocusing results
compared to other state of the art methods.","SAR,image,phase",
Cross-border road transport in EU law context,"Have you ever wondered which legal rules are applicable to cross-border EU road transport? Are you interested in the issues revolving around EU employment law in the international road transport sector? Then, on behalf of the University of Antwerp, Erasmus University Rotterdam, University of Gda?sk, University of Luxembourg and Tilburg University, we would like to welcome you to this MOOC on Cross-border Road Transport in EU law context. This MOOC is a part of the Erasmus + Project funded by the European Commission. In this MOOC, you will not only learn what the current legal framework is, but also, how it is applied in the road transport sector. After participating in this MOOC, you will be able to: 1. Describe the basics of the process of European integration, in the light of the affirmation of the four fundamental freedoms of the EU, European framework on private international law, the posting of workers, social security coordination and social dialogue. 2. Understand the interplay between Treaty provisions and secondary sources in the relevant fields. 3. Understand the frictions between the rationales underneath the legal provisions that govern EU social policy and labour law. 4. Analyse the most relevant case law of the European Court of Justice with an impact on the rights of international road transport workers. 5. Familiarise with official documents of the EU institutions and with academic and other relevant literature in this field. 6. Use, where relevant, the implementation of EU rules by Member States. 7. Solve cases dealing with the implementation of the applicable legal provisions. We are offering you knowledge clips, memoranda that contain in-depth legal information on the different key topics, recommended readings and case law. Next to that after each module, you could test your acquired knowledge by taking a multiple choice test. In the end of this course, you will be able to apply everything you have learned in a practical manner by solving our sample guide case that resembles a real life scenario which challenges you to deal with everyday's problems faced in the cross-border road transport by practitioners in the field. By participating in this MOOC, you will find answers to the following questions: 1. Which of the four fundamental freedoms is applicable? 2. Which court has jurisdiction over a labour dispute and which law governs the cross-border employment relation? 3. How to apply and enforce the rules stemming from the Posting of Workers Directive? 4. Which social security system is applicable and which social security institution is competent to levy the social security contributions? 5. What is the role of social partners in the cross-border road transport? In the end it all makes SENSE! So let's go down this road together. Buckle up!","University,road,transport",
Continual Learning Augmented Investment Decisions,"Investment decisions can benefit from incorporating an accumulated knowledge
of the past to drive future decision making. We introduce Continual Learning
Augmentation (CLA) which is based on an explicit memory structure and a feed
forward neural network (FFNN) base model and used to drive long term financial
investment decisions. We demonstrate that our approach improves accuracy in
investment decision making while memory is addressed in an explainable way. Our
approach introduces novel remember cues, consisting of empirically learned
change points in the absolute error series of the FFNN. Memory recall is also
novel, with contextual similarity assessed over time by sampling distances
using dynamic time warping (DTW). We demonstrate the benefits of our approach
by using it in an expected return forecasting task to drive investment
decisions. In an investment simulation in a broad international equity universe
between 2003-2017, our approach significantly outperforms FFNN base models. We
also illustrate how CLA's memory addressing works in practice, using a worked
example to demonstrate the explainability of our approach.","Investment,approach,FFNN",
Finding the Right Bricks for Molecular Lego: A Data Mining Approach to Organic Semiconductor Design,"Improving charge carrier mobilities in organic semiconductors is a
challenging task that has hitherto primarily been tackled by empirical
structural tuning of promising core compounds. Knowledge-based methods can
greatly accelerate such local exploration, while a systematic analysis of large
chemical databases can point towards promising design strategies. Here, we
demonstrate such data mining by clustering an in-house database of >64.000
organic molecular crystals for which two charge-transport descriptors, the
electronic coupling and the reorganization energy, have been calculated from
first principles. The clustering is performed according to the Bemis-Murcko
scaffolds of the constituting molecules and according to the sidegroups with
which these molecular backbones are functionalized. In both cases, we obtain
statistically significant structure-property relationships with certain
scaffolds (sidegroups) consistently leading to favorable charge-transport
properties. Functionalizing promising scaffolds with favorable sidegroups
results in engineered molecular crystals for which we indeed compute improved
charge-transport properties.","promising,Improving,compounds",

"A distributed, plug-n-play algorithm for multi-robot applications with a priori non-computable objective functions","This paper presents a distributed algorithm applicable to a wide range of
practical multi-robot applications. In such multi-robot applications, the
user-defined objectives of the mission can be cast as a general optimization
problem, without explicit guidelines of the subtasks per different robot. Owing
to the unknown environment, unknown robot dynamics, sensor nonlinearities,
etc., the analytic form of the optimization cost function is not available a
priori. Therefore, standard gradient-descent-like algorithms are not applicable
to these problems. To tackle this, we introduce a new algorithm that carefully
designs each robot's subcost function, the optimization of which can accomplish
the overall team objective. Upon this transformation, we propose a distributed
methodology based on the cognitive-based adaptive optimization (CAO) algorithm,
that is able to approximate the evolution of each robot's cost function and to
adequately optimize its decision variables (robot actions). The latter can be
achieved by online learning only the problem-specific characteristics that
affect the accomplishment of mission objectives. The overall, low-complexity
algorithm can straightforwardly incorporate any kind of operational constraint,
is fault tolerant, and can appropriately tackle time-varying cost functions. A
cornerstone of this approach is that it shares the same convergence
characteristics as those of block coordinate descent algorithms. The proposed
algorithm is evaluated in three heterogeneous simulation set-ups under multiple
scenarios, against both general-purpose and problem-specific algorithms. Source

Mobile 3D Printing Robot Simulation with Viscoelastic Fluids,"The system design and algorithm development of mobile 3D printing robots need
a realistic simulation. They require a mobile robot simulation platform to
interoperate with a physics-based material simulation for handling interactions
between the time-variant deformable 3D printing materials and other simulated
rigid bodies in the environment, which is not available for roboticists yet. To
bridge this gap and enable the real-time simulation of mobile 3D printing
processes, we develop a simulation framework that includes particle-based
viscoelastic fluid simulation and particle-to-mesh conversion in the widely
adopted Gazebo robotics simulator, avoiding the bottlenecks of traditional
additive manufacturing simulation approaches. This framework is the first of
its kind that enables the simulation of robot arms or mobile manipulators
together with viscoelastic fluids. The method is tested using various material
properties and multiple collaborating robots to demonstrate its simulation
ability for the robots to plan and control the printhead trajectories and to
visually sense at the same time the printed fluid materials as a free-form
mesh. The scalability as a function of available material particles in the
simulation was also studied. A simulation with an average of 5 FPS was achieved

This course is designed for people with some technical competencies who would like more than a ""cookbook"" approach, but who still need to concentrate on the routine sorts of presentation and analysis that deepen the understanding of our professional topics. In practical Time Series Analysis we look at data sets that represent sequential information, such as stock prices, annual rainfall, sunspot activity, the price of agricultural products, and more. We look at several mathematical models that might be used to describe the processes which generate these types of data. We also look at graphical representations that provide insights into our data. Finally, we also learn how to make forecasts that say intelligent things about what we might expect in the future. Please take a few minutes to explore the course site. You will find video lectures with supporting written materials as well as quizzes to help emphasize important points. The language for the course is R, a free implementation of the S language.

DeFeat-Net: General Monocular Depth via Simultaneous Unsupervised Representation Learning,"In the current monocular depth research, the dominant approach is to employ
unsupervised training on large datasets, driven by warped photometric
consistency. Such approaches lack robustness and are unable to generalize to
challenging domains such as nighttime scenes or adverse weather conditions
where assumptions about photometric consistency break down.
We propose DeFeat-Net (Depth & Feature network), an approach to
simultaneously learn a cross-domain dense feature representation, alongside a
robust depth-estimation framework based on warped feature consistency. The
resulting feature representation is learned in an unsupervised manner with no
explicit ground-truth correspondences required.
We show that within a single domain, our technique is comparable to both the
current state of the art in monocular depth estimation and supervised feature
representation learning. However, by simultaneously learning features, depth
and motion, our technique is able to generalize to challenging domains,
allowing DeFeat-Net to outperform the current state-of-the-art with around 10%
reduction in all error measures on more challenging sequences such as nighttime
driving.","Feature,depth,consistency",
Graph Based Multi-layer K-means++ (G-MLKM) for Sensory Pattern Analysis in Constrained Spaces,"In this paper, we focus on developing a novel unsupervised machine learning
algorithm, named graph based multi-layer k-means++ (G-MLKM), to solve
data-target association problem when targets move on a constrained space and
minimal information of the targets can be obtained by sensors. Instead of
employing the traditional data-target association methods that are based on
statistical probabilities, the G-MLKM solves the problem via data clustering.
We first will develop the Multi-layer K-means++ (MLKM) method for data-target
association at local space given a simplified constrained space situation. Then
a p-dual graph is proposed to represent the general constrained space when
local spaces are interconnected. Based on the dual graph and graph theory, we
then generalize MLKM to G-MLKM by first understanding local data-target
association and then extracting cross-local data-target association
mathematically analyze the data association at intersections of that space. To
exclude potential data-target association errors that disobey physical rules,
we also develop error correction mechanisms to further improve the accuracy.
Numerous simulation examples are conducted to demonstrate the performance of
G-MLKM.","association,data-target,space",

How Does BN Increase Collapsed Neural Network Filters?,"Improving sparsity of deep neural networks (DNNs) is essential for network
compression and has drawn much attention. In this work, we disclose a harmful
sparsifying process called filter collapse, which is common in DNNs with batch
normalization (BN) and rectified linear activation functions (e.g. ReLU, Leaky
ReLU). It occurs even without explicit sparsity-inducing regularizations such
as $L_1$. This phenomenon is caused by the normalization effect of BN, which
induces a non-trainable region in the parameter space and reduces the network
capacity as a result. This phenomenon becomes more prominent when the network
is trained with large learning rates (LR) or adaptive LR schedulers, and when
the network is finetuned. We analytically prove that the parameters of BN tend
to become sparser during SGD updates with high gradient noise and that the
sparsifying probability is proportional to the square of learning rate and
inversely proportional to the square of the scale parameter of BN. To prevent
the undesirable collapsed filters, we propose a simple yet effective approach
named post-shifted BN (psBN), which has the same representation ability as BN
while being able to automatically make BN parameters trainable again as they
saturate during training. With psBN, we can recover collapsed filters and
increase the model performance in various tasks such as classification on
CIFAR-10 and object detection on MS-COCO2017.","network,DNNs,ReLU",

LayerPipe: Accelerating Deep Neural Network Training by Intra-Layer and Inter-Layer Gradient Pipelining and Multiprocessor Scheduling,"The time required for training the neural networks increases with size,
complexity, and depth. Training model parameters by backpropagation inherently
creates feedback loops. These loops hinder efficient pipelining and scheduling
of the tasks within the layer and between consecutive layers. Prior approaches,
such as PipeDream, have exploited the use of delayed gradient to achieve
inter-layer pipelining. However, these approaches treat the entire
backpropagation as a single task; this leads to an increase in computation time
and processor underutilization. This paper presents novel optimization
approaches where the gradient computations with respect to the weights and the
activation functions are considered independently; therefore, these can be
computed in parallel. This is referred to as intra-layer optimization.
Additionally, the gradient computation with respect to the activation function
is further divided into two parts and distributed to two consecutive layers.
This leads to balanced scheduling where the computation time of each layer is
the same. This is referred to as inter-layer optimization. The proposed system,
referred to as LayerPipe, reduces the number of clock cycles required for
training while maximizing processor utilization with minimal inter-processor
communication overhead. LayerPipe achieves an average speedup of 25% and
upwards of 80% with 7 to 9 processors with less communication overhead when
compared to PipeDream.","training,computation,gradient",

Nambu-Covariant Many-Body Theory I: Perturbative Approximations,"Symmetry-breaking considerations play an important role in allowing reliable
and accurate predictions of complex systems in quantum many-body simulations.
The general theory of perturbations in symmetry-breaking phases is nonetheless
intrinsically more involved than in the unbroken phase due to non-vanishing
anomalous Green's functions or anomalous quasiparticle interactions. In the
present paper, we develop a formulation of many-body theory at non-zero
temperature which is explicitly covariant with respect to a group containing
Bogoliubov transformations. Based on the concept of Nambu tensors, we derive a
factorisation of standard Feynman diagrams that is valid for a general

un-oriented Feynman diagrams with fully antisymmetric vertices. We argue that,
within this framework, the design of symmetry-breaking many-body approximations
is simplified.","Symmetry-breaking,simulations,many-body",
Making History Matter: History-Advantage Sequence Training for Visual Dialog,"We study the multi-round response generation in visual dialog, where a
response is generated according to a visually grounded conversational history.
Given a triplet: an image, Q&A history, and current question, all the
prevailing methods follow a codec (i.e., encoder-decoder) fashion in a
supervised learning paradigm: a multimodal encoder encodes the triplet into a
feature vector, which is then fed into the decoder for the current answer
generation, supervised by the ground-truth. However, this conventional
supervised learning does NOT take into account the impact of imperfect history,
violating the conversational nature of visual dialog and thus making the codec
more inclined to learn history bias but not contextual reasoning. To this end,
inspired by the actor-critic policy gradient in reinforcement learning, we
propose a novel training paradigm called History Advantage Sequence Training
(HAST). Specifically, we intentionally impose wrong answers in the history,
obtaining an adverse critic, and see how the historic error impacts the codec's
future behavior by History Advantage-a quantity obtained by subtracting the
adverse critic from the gold reward of ground-truth history. Moreover, to make
the codec more sensitive to the history, we propose a novel attention network
called History-Aware Co-Attention Network (HACAN) which can be effectively
trained by using HAST. Experimental results on three benchmarks: VisDial
v0.9&v1.0 and GuessWhat?!, show that the proposed HAST strategy consistently
outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised counterparts.","history,response,codec",

detected a diffuse flux of astrophysical neutrinos that appears to be of
extragalactic origin. A possible contribution to this diffuse flux could stem
from core-collapse supernovae. The high-energy neutrinos could either come from
the interaction of the ejecta with a dense circumstellar medium or a jet,
emanating from the star's core, that stalls in the star's envelope. Here, we
will present results of a stacking analysis to search for this high-energy

MultiAzterTest: a Multilingual Analyzer on Multiple Levels of Language for Readability Assessment,"Readability assessment is the task of determining how difficult or easy a

Unsupervised model compression for multilayer bootstrap networks,"Recently, multilayer bootstrap network (MBN) has demonstrated promising
performance in unsupervised dimensionality reduction. It can learn compact
representations in standard data sets, i.e. MNIST and RCV1. However, as a
bootstrap method, the prediction complexity of MBN is high. In this paper, we
propose an unsupervised model compression framework for this general problem of
unsupervised bootstrap methods. The framework compresses a large unsupervised
bootstrap model into a small model by taking the bootstrap model and its
application together as a black box and learning a mapping function from the
input of the bootstrap model to the output of the application by a supervised
learner. To specialize the framework, we propose a new technique, named
compressive MBN. It takes MBN as the unsupervised bootstrap model and deep
neural network (DNN) as the supervised learner. Our initial result on MNIST
showed that compressive MBN not only maintains the high prediction accuracy of
MBN but also is over thousands of times faster than MBN at the prediction
stage. Our result suggests that the new technique integrates the effectiveness
of MBN on unsupervised learning and the effectiveness and efficiency of DNN on
supervised learning together for the effectiveness and efficiency of
compressive MBN on unsupervised learning.","MBN,bootstrap,unsupervised",

Compact Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control for Energy Saving: Air Drag Modelling and Simulation,"This paper studies the value of communicated motion predictions in the
longitudinal control of connected automated vehicles (CAVs). We focus on a safe
cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) design and analyze the value of
vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication in the presence of uncertain front
vehicle acceleration. The interest in CACC is motivated by the potential
improvement in energy consumption and road throughput. In order to quantify
this potential, we characterize experimentally the relationship between
inter-vehicular gap, vehicle speed, and (reduction of) energy consumption for a
compact plug-in hybrid electric vehicle. The resulting model is leveraged to
show efficacy of our control design, which pursues small inter-vehicle gaps
between consecutive CAVs and, therefore, improved energy efficiency. Our
proposed control design is based on a robust model predictive control framework
to systematically account for the system uncertainties. We present a set of
thorough simulations aimed at quantifying energy efficiency improvement when
vehicle states and predictions exchanged via V2V communication are used in the

End-to-End User Behavior Retrieval in Click-Through RatePrediction Model,"Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is one of the core tasks in recommender
systems (RS). It predicts a personalized click probability for each user-item
pair. Recently, researchers have found that the performance of CTR model can be
improved greatly by taking user behavior sequence into consideration,
especially long-term user behavior sequence. The report on an e-commerce
website shows that 23\% of users have more than 1000 clicks during the past 5
months. Though there are numerous works focus on modeling sequential user
behaviors, few works can handle long-term user behavior sequence due to the
strict inference time constraint in real world system. Two-stage methods are
proposed to push the limit for better performance. At the first stage, an
auxiliary task is designed to retrieve the top-$k$ similar items from long-term
user behavior sequence. At the second stage, the classical attention mechanism
is conducted between the candidate item and $k$ items selected in the first
stage. However, information gap happens between retrieval stage and the main
CTR task. This goal divergence can greatly diminishing the performance gain of
long-term user sequence. In this paper, inspired by Reformer, we propose a
locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) method called ETA (End-to-end Target
Attention) which can greatly reduce the training and inference cost and make
the end-to-end training with long-term user behavior sequence possible. Both
offline and online experiments confirm the effectiveness of our model. We
deploy ETA into a large-scale real world E-commerce system and achieve extra
3.1\% improvements on GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) compared to a two-stage

LES3: Learning-based Exact Set Similarity Search,"Set similarity search is a problem of central interest to a wide variety of
applications such as data cleaning and web search. Past approaches on set
similarity search utilize either heavy indexing structures, incurring large
search costs or indexes that produce large candidate sets. In this paper, we
design a learning-based exact set similarity search approach, LES3. Our
approach first partitions sets into groups, and then utilizes a light-weight
bitmap-like indexing structure, called token-group matrix (TGM), to organize
groups and prune out candidates given a query set. In order to optimize pruning
using the TGM, we analytically investigate the optimal partitioning strategy
under certain distributional assumptions. Using these results, we then design a
learning-based partitioning approach called L2P and an associated data
representation encoding, PTR, to identify the partitions. We conduct extensive
experiments on real and synthetic datasets to fully study LES3, establishing
the effectiveness and superiority over other applicable approaches.","search,similarity,Set",
Towards Optimal Transport with Global Invariances,"Many problems in machine learning involve calculating correspondences between
sets of objects, such as point clouds or images. Discrete optimal transport
provides a natural and successful approach to such tasks whenever the two sets
of objects can be represented in the same space, or at least distances between
them can be directly evaluated. Unfortunately neither requirement is likely to
hold when object representations are learned from data. Indeed, automatically
derived representations such as word embeddings are typically fixed only up to
some global transformations, for example, reflection or rotation. As a result,
pairwise distances across two such instances are ill-defined without specifying
their relative transformation. In this work, we propose a general framework for
optimal transport in the presence of latent global transformations. We cast the
problem as a joint optimization over transport couplings and transformations
chosen from a flexible class of invariances, propose algorithms to solve it,
and show promising results in various tasks, including a popular unsupervised
word translation benchmark.","sets,images,objects",

Rethinking and Improving the Robustness of Image Style Transfer,"Extensive research in neural style transfer methods has shown that the
correlation between features extracted by a pre-trained VGG network has a
remarkable ability to capture the visual style of an image. Surprisingly,
however, this stylization quality is not robust and often degrades
significantly when applied to features from more advanced and lightweight
networks, such as those in the ResNet family. By performing extensive
experiments with different network architectures, we find that residual
connections, which represent the main architectural difference between VGG and
ResNet, produce feature maps of small entropy, which are not suitable for style
transfer. To improve the robustness of the ResNet architecture, we then propose
a simple yet effective solution based on a softmax transformation of the
feature activations that enhances their entropy. Experimental results
demonstrate that this small magic can greatly improve the quality of
stylization results, even for networks with random weights. This suggests that
the architecture used for feature extraction is more important than the use of
learned weights for the task of style transfer.","VGG,style,transfer",
Temporal-Difference Value Estimation via Uncertainty-Guided Soft Updates,"Temporal-Difference (TD) learning methods, such as Q-Learning, have proven
effective at learning a policy to perform control tasks. One issue with methods
like Q-Learning is that the value update introduces bias when predicting the TD
target of a unfamiliar state. Estimation noise becomes a bias after the max
operator in the policy improvement step, and carries over to value estimations
of other states, causing Q-Learning to overestimate the Q value. Algorithms
like Soft Q-Learning (SQL) introduce the notion of a soft-greedy policy, which
reduces the estimation bias via soft updates in early stages of training.
However, the inverse temperature $\beta$ that controls the softness of an
update is usually set by a hand-designed heuristic, which can be inaccurate at
capturing the uncertainty in the target estimate. Under the belief that $\beta$
is closely related to the (state dependent) model uncertainty, Entropy
Regularized Q-Learning (EQL) further introduces a principled scheduling of
$\beta$ by maintaining a collection of the model parameters that characterizes
model uncertainty. In this paper, we present Unbiased Soft Q-Learning (UQL),
which extends the work of EQL from two action, finite state spaces to
multi-action, infinite state space Markov Decision Processes. We also provide a
principled numerical scheduling of $\beta$, extended from SQL and using model
uncertainty, during the optimization process. We show the theoretical
guarantees and the effectiveness of this update method in experiments on
several discrete control environments.","Q-Learning,learning,beta",

A Multi-Object Rectified Attention Network for Scene Text Recognition,"Irregular text is widely used. However, it is considerably difficult to
recognize because of its various shapes and distorted patterns. In this paper,
we thus propose a multi-object rectified attention network (MORAN) for general
scene text recognition. The MORAN consists of a multi-object rectification
network and an attention-based sequence recognition network. The multi-object
rectification network is designed for rectifying images that contain irregular
text. It decreases the difficulty of recognition and enables the
attention-based sequence recognition network to more easily read irregular
text. It is trained in a weak supervision way, thus requiring only images and
corresponding text labels. The attention-based sequence recognition network
focuses on target characters and sequentially outputs the predictions.
Moreover, to improve the sensitivity of the attention-based sequence
recognition network, a fractional pickup method is proposed for an
attention-based decoder in the training phase. With the rectification
mechanism, the MORAN can read both regular and irregular scene text. Extensive
experiments on various benchmarks are conducted, which show that the MORAN
achieves state-of-the-art performance. The source code is available.","network,recognition,MORAN",

Adversarial Semantic Contour for Object Detection,"Modern object detectors are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which brings
potential risks to numerous applications, e.g., self-driving car. Among attacks
regularized by $\ell_p$ norm, $\ell_0$-attack aims to modify as few pixels as
possible. Nevertheless, the problem is nontrivial since it generally requires
to optimize the shape along with the texture simultaneously, which is an
NP-hard problem. To address this issue, we propose a novel method of
Adversarial Semantic Contour (ASC) guided by object contour as prior. With this
prior, we reduce the searching space to accelerate the $\ell_0$ optimization,
and also introduce more semantic information which should affect the detectors
more. Based on the contour, we optimize the selection of modified pixels via
sampling and their colors with gradient descent alternately. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our proposed ASC outperforms the most commonly
manually designed patterns (e.g., square patches and grids) on task of
disappearing. By modifying no more than 5\% and 3.5\% of the object area
respectively, our proposed ASC can successfully mislead the mainstream object
detectors including the SSD512, Yolov4, Mask RCNN, Faster RCNN, etc.","ell,ASC,object",

"One Network to Segment Them All: A General, Lightweight System for Accurate 3D Medical Image Segmentation","Many recent medical segmentation systems rely on powerful deep learning
models to solve highly specific tasks. To maximize performance, it is standard
practice to evaluate numerous pipelines with varying model topologies,
optimization parameters, pre- & postprocessing steps, and even model cascades.
It is often not clear how the resulting pipeline transfers to different tasks.
We propose a simple and thoroughly evaluated deep learning framework for
segmentation of arbitrary medical image volumes. The system requires no
task-specific information, no human interaction and is based on a fixed model
topology and a fixed hyperparameter set, eliminating the process of model
selection and its inherent tendency to cause method-level over-fitting. The
system is available in open source and does not require deep learning expertise
to use. Without task-specific modifications, the system performed better than
or similar to highly specialized deep learning methods across 3 separate
segmentation tasks. In addition, it ranked 5-th and 6-th in the first and
second round of the 2018 Medical Segmentation Decathlon comprising another 10
tasks. The system relies on multi-planar data augmentation which facilitates
the application of a single 2D architecture based on the familiar U-Net.
Multi-planar training combines the parameter efficiency of a 2D fully

Joint Geometry and Color Projection-based Point Cloud Quality Metric,"Point cloud coding solutions have been recently standardized to address the
needs of multiple application scenarios. The design and assessment of point

Several point cloud objective quality metrics has been recently proposed to
reliable estimate human perceived quality, including the so-called
projection-based metrics. In this context, this paper proposes a joint geometry
and color projection-based point cloud objective quality metric which solves
the critical weakness of this type of quality metrics, i.e., the misalignment
between the reference and degraded projected images. Moreover, the proposed
point cloud quality metric exploits the best performing 2D quality metrics in
the literature to assess the quality of the projected images. The experimental
results show that the proposed projection-based quality metric offers the best

Graph Kernel Attention Transformers,"We introduce a new class of graph neural networks (GNNs), by combining
several concepts that were so far studied independently - graph kernels,
attention-based networks with structural priors and more recently, efficient
Transformers architectures applying small memory footprint implicit attention
methods via low rank decomposition techniques. The goal of the paper is
twofold. Proposed by us Graph Kernel Attention Transformers (or GKATs) are much
more expressive than SOTA GNNs as capable of modeling longer-range dependencies
within a single layer. Consequently, they can use more shallow architecture
design. Furthermore, GKAT attention layers scale linearly rather than
quadratically in the number of nodes of the input graphs, even when those
graphs are dense, requiring less compute than their regular graph attention
counterparts. They achieve it by applying new classes of graph kernels
admitting random feature map decomposition via random walks on graphs. As a
byproduct of the introduced techniques, we obtain a new class of learnable
graph sketches, called graphots, compactly encoding topological graph
properties as well as nodes' features. We conducted exhaustive empirical
comparison of our method with nine different GNN classes on tasks ranging from
motif detection through social network classification to bioinformatics
challenges, showing consistent gains coming from GKATs.","graph,attention,efficient",

How to Simplify Search: Classification-wise Pareto Evolution for One-shot Neural Architecture Search,"In the deployment of deep neural models, how to effectively and automatically
find feasible deep models under diverse design objectives is fundamental. Most
existing neural architecture search (NAS) methods utilize surrogates to predict
the detailed performance (e.g., accuracy and model size) of a candidate
architecture during the search, which however is complicated and inefficient.
In contrast, we aim to learn an efficient Pareto classifier to simplify the
search process of NAS by transforming the complex multi-objective NAS task into
a simple Pareto-dominance classification task. To this end, we propose a
classification-wise Pareto evolution approach for one-shot NAS, where an online
classifier is trained to predict the dominance relationship between the
candidate and constructed reference architectures, instead of using surrogates
to fit the objective functions. The main contribution of this study is to
change supernet adaption into a Pareto classifier. Besides, we design two
adaptive schemes to select the reference set of architectures for constructing
classification boundary and regulate the rate of positive samples over negative
ones, respectively. We compare the proposed evolution approach with
state-of-the-art approaches on widely-used benchmark datasets, and experimental
results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms other approaches and
have found a number of neural architectures with different model sizes ranging
from 2M to 6M under diverse objectives and constraints.","NAS,deep,Pareto",

Structured second-order methods via natural gradient descent,"In this paper, we propose new structured second-order methods and structured
adaptive-gradient methods obtained by performing natural-gradient descent on
structured parameter spaces. Natural-gradient descent is an attractive approach
to design new algorithms in many settings such as gradient-free,
adaptive-gradient, and second-order methods. Our structured methods not only
enjoy a structural invariance but also admit a simple expression. Finally, we
test the efficiency of our proposed methods on both deterministic non-convex
problems and deep learning problems.","methods,structured,second-order",

The Boundary and Taxonomy of Integrator Reach Sets,"Over-approximating the forward reach sets of controlled dynamical systems
subject to set-valued uncertainties is a common practice in systems-control
engineering for the purpose of performance verification. However, specific
algebraic and topological results for the geometry of such sets are rather
uncommon even for simple linear systems such as the integrators. This work
explores the geometry of the forward reach set of the integrator dynamics
subject to compact set-valued uncertainties in its control inputs. Our
contribution includes derivation of a closed-form formula for the support
functions of these sets. This result, then enables us to deduce the parametric
as well as the implicit equations describing the \emph{exact} boundaries of
these reach sets. Specifically, the implicit equations for the bounding
hypersurfaces are shown to be given by vanishing of certain Hankel
determinants. Finally, it is established that the integrator reach sets are
semialgebraic as well as translated zonoids. These results should be useful to
benchmark existing reach set over-approximation algorithms, and to help design
new algorithms for the same.","sets,reach,systems",

Topic Transferable Table Question Answering,"Weakly-supervised table question-answering(TableQA) models have achieved
state-of-art performance by using pre-trained BERT transformer to jointly
encoding a question and a table to produce structured query for the question.
However, in practical settings TableQA systems are deployed over table corpora
having topic and word distributions quite distinct from BERT's pretraining
corpus. In this work we simulate the practical topic shift scenario by
designing novel challenge benchmarks WikiSQL-TS and WikiTQ-TS, consisting of
train-dev-test splits in five distinct topic groups, based on the popular
WikiSQL and WikiTableQuestions datasets. We empirically show that, despite
pre-training on large open-domain text, performance of models degrades
significantly when they are evaluated on unseen topics. In response, we propose
T3QA (Topic Transferable Table Question Answering) a pragmatic adaptation
framework for TableQA comprising of: (1) topic-specific vocabulary injection
into BERT, (2) a novel text-to-text transformer generator (such as T5, GPT2)
based natural language question generation pipeline focused on generating topic
specific training data, and (3) a logical form reranker. We show that T3QA
provides a reasonably good baseline for our topic shift benchmarks. We believe
our topic split benchmarks will lead to robust TableQA solutions that are
better suited for practical deployment.","BERT,topic,table",

A single metagrating metastructure for wave-based parallel analog computing,"Wave-based signal processing has witnessed a significant expansion of
interest in a variety of science and engineering disciplines, as it provides
new opportunities for achieving high-speed and low-power operations. Although
flat optics desires integrable components to perform multiple missions, yet,
the current wave-based analog computers can engineer only the spatial content
of the input signal where the processed signal obeys the traditional version of
Snell's law. In this paper, we propose a multi-functional metagrating to
modulate both spatial and angular properties of the input signal whereby both
symmetric and asymmetric optical transfer functions are realized using
high-order space harmonics. The performance of the designed compound metallic
grating is validated through several investigations where closed-form
expressions are suggested to extract the phase and amplitude information of the
diffractive modes. Several illustrative examples are demonstrated to show that
the proposed metagrating allows for simultaneous parallel analog computing
tasks such as first- and second-order spatial differentiation through a single
multi-channel structured surface. It is anticipated that the designed platform
brings a new twist to the field of optical signal processing and opens up large
perspectives for simple integrated image processing systems.","signal,Wave-based,processing",

An Image Analogies Approach for Multi-Scale Contour Detection,"In this paper we deal with contour detection based on the recent image
analogy principle which has been successfully used for super-resolution,
texture and curves synthesis and interactive editing. Hand-drawn outlines are
initially as benchmarks. Given such a reference image, we present a new method
based on this expertise to locate contours of a query image in the same way
that it is done for the reference (i.e by analogy).
Applying a image analogies for contour detection using hand drawn images as
leaning images cannot gives good result for any query image. The contour
detection may be improved if we increase the number of learning images such
that there will be exist similarity between query image and some reference
images. In addition of the hardness of contours drawing task, this will
increase considerably the time computation.
We investigated in this work, how can we avoid this constraint in order to
guaranty that all contour pixels will be located for any query image. Fourteen
derived stereo patches, derived from a mathematical study, are the knowledge
used in order to locate contours at different scales independently of the light
conditions.
Comprehensive experiments are conducted on different data sets (BSD 500,
Horses of Weizmann). The obtained results show superior performance via
precision and recall vs. hand-drawn contours at multiple resolutions to the
reported state of the art.","image,query,contour",

approach can be paired with an object detection and segmentation method to
estimate, refine and track the pose of the objects by matching the input image

Cooperative Policy Learning with Pre-trained Heterogeneous Observation Representations,"Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been increasingly explored to
learn the cooperative policy towards maximizing a certain global reward. Many
existing studies take advantage of graph neural networks (GNN) in MARL to
propagate critical collaborative information over the interaction graph, built
upon inter-connected agents. Nevertheless, the vanilla GNN approach yields
substantial defects in dealing with complex real-world scenarios since the
generic message passing mechanism is ineffective between heterogeneous vertices
and, moreover, simple message aggregation functions are incapable of accurately
modeling the combinational interactions from multiple neighbors. While adopting
complex GNN models with more informative message passing and aggregation
mechanisms can obviously benefit heterogeneous vertex representations and
cooperative policy learning, it could, on the other hand, increase the training
difficulty of MARL and demand more intense and direct reward signals compared
to the original global reward. To address these challenges, we propose a new
cooperative learning framework with pre-trained heterogeneous observation
representations. Particularly, we employ an encoder-decoder based graph
attention to learn the intricate interactions and heterogeneous representations
that can be more easily leveraged by MARL. Moreover, we design a pre-training
with local actor-critic algorithm to ease the difficulty in cooperative policy
learning. Extensive experiments over real-world scenarios demonstrate that our
new approach can significantly outperform existing MARL baselines as well as
operational research solutions that are widely-used in industry.","MARL,GNN,cooperative",

Solon: Communication-efficient Byzantine-resilient Distributed Training via Redundant Gradients,"There has been a growing need to provide Byzantine-resilience in distributed
model training. Existing robust distributed learning algorithms focus on
developing sophisticated robust aggregators at the parameter servers, but pay
less attention to balancing the communication cost and robustness. In this
paper, we propose Solon, an algorithmic framework that exploits gradient
redundancy to provide communication efficiency and Byzantine robustness
simultaneously. Our theoretical analysis shows a fundamental trade-off among
computational load, communication cost, and Byzantine robustness. We also
develop a concrete algorithm to achieve the optimal trade-off, borrowing ideas
from coding theory and sparse recovery. Empirical experiments on various
datasets demonstrate that Solon provides significant speedups over existing
methods to achieve the same accuracy, over 10 times faster than Bulyan and 80%
faster than Draco. We also show that carefully designed Byzantine attacks break
Signum and Bulyan, but do not affect the successful convergence of Solon.","Byzantine-resilience,Byzantine,Solon",
An End-to-End Visual-Audio Attention Network for Emotion Recognition in User-Generated Videos,"Emotion recognition in user-generated videos plays an important role in
human-centered computing. Existing methods mainly employ traditional two-stage
shallow pipeline, i.e. extracting visual and/or audio features and training
classifiers. In this paper, we propose to recognize video emotions in an
end-to-end manner based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Specifically,
we develop a deep Visual-Audio Attention Network (VAANet), a novel architecture
that integrates spatial, channel-wise, and temporal attentions into a visual 3D
CNN and temporal attentions into an audio 2D CNN. Further, we design a special
classification loss, i.e. polarity-consistent cross-entropy loss, based on the
polarity-emotion hierarchy constraint to guide the attention generation.
Extensive experiments conducted on the challenging VideoEmotion-8 and Ekman-6
datasets demonstrate that the proposed VAANet outperforms the state-of-the-art
approaches for video emotion recognition. Our source code is released at:

Toward quantifying trust dynamics: How people adjust their trust after moment-to-moment interaction with automation,"Objective: We examine how human operators adjust their trust in automation as
a result of their moment-to-moment interaction with automation. Background:
Most existing studies measured trust by administering questionnaires at the end
of an experiment. Only a limited number of studies viewed trust as a dynamic
variable that can strengthen or decay over time. Method: Seventy-five
participants took part in an aided memory recognition task. In the task,
participants viewed a series of images and later on performed 40 trials of the
recognition task to identify a target image when it was presented with a
distractor. In each trial, participants performed the initial recognition by
themselves, received a recommendation from an automated decision aid, and
performed the final recognition. After each trial, participants reported their
trust on a visual analog scale. Results: Outcome bias and contrast effect
significantly influence human operators' trust adjustments. An automation
failure leads to a larger trust decrement if the final outcome is undesirable,
and a marginally larger trust decrement if the human operator succeeds the task
by him-/her-self. An automation success engenders a greater trust increment if
the human operator fails the task. Additionally, automation failures have a
larger effect on trust adjustment than automation successes. Conclusion: Human
operators adjust their trust in automation as a result of their
moment-to-moment interaction with automation. Their trust adjustments are
significantly influenced by decision-making heuristics/biases. Application:
Understanding the trust adjustment process enables accurate prediction of the
operators' moment-to-moment trust in automation and informs the design of
trust-aware adaptive automation.","trust,automation,human",
Metal Artifact Reduction in 2D CT Images with Self-supervised Cross-domain Learning,"The presence of metallic implants often introduces severe metal artifacts in
the X-ray CT images, which could adversely influence clinical diagnosis or dose
calculation in radiation therapy. In this work, we present a novel
deep-learning-based approach for metal artifact reduction (MAR). In order to
alleviate the need for anatomically identical CT image pairs (i.e., metal
artifact-corrupted CT image and metal artifact-free CT image) for network
learning, we propose a self-supervised cross-domain learning framework.
Specifically, we train a neural network to restore the metal trace region
values in the given metal-free sinogram, where the metal trace is identified by
the forward projection of metal masks. We then design a novel FBP
reconstruction loss to encourage the network to generate more perfect
completion results and a residual-learning-based image refinement module to
reduce the secondary artifacts in the reconstructed CT images. To preserve the
fine structure details and fidelity of the final MAR image, instead of directly
adopting CNN-refined images as output, we incorporate the metal trace
replacement into our framework and replace the metal-affected projections of
the original sinogram with the prior sinogram generated by the forward
projection of the CNN output. We then use the filtered backward projection
(FBP) algorithms for final MAR image reconstruction. We conduct an extensive
evaluation on simulated and real artifact data to show the effectiveness of our
design. Our method produces superior MAR results and outperforms other
compelling methods. We also demonstrate the potential of our framework for
other organ sites.","metal,image,MAR",

"Parallel Medical Imaging for Intelligent Medical Image Analysis: Concepts, Methods, and Applications","There has been much progress in data-driven artificial intelligence
technology for medical image analysis in the last decades. However, it still
remains challenging due to its distinctive complexity of acquiring and
annotating image data, extracting medical domain knowledge, and explaining the
diagnostic decision for medical image analysis. In this paper, we propose a
data-knowledge-driven framework termed as Parallel Medical Imaging (PMI) for

experiments with predictive learning in a data-driven way are conducted to
extract medical knowledge for diagnostic decision support. Artificial imaging

framework can boost the generalization ability and alleviate the limitation of
medical interpretation for diagnostic decisions. Furthermore, we illustrate the
preliminary implementation of PMI method through the case studies of mammogram
analysis and skin lesion image analysis. Experimental results on several public

Post-hoc Models for Performance Estimation of Machine Learning Inference,"Estimating how well a machine learning model performs during inference is
critical in a variety of scenarios (for example, to quantify uncertainty, or to
choose from a library of available models). However, the standard accuracy
estimate of softmax confidence is not versatile and cannot reliably predict
different performance metrics (e.g., F1-score, recall) or the performance in
different application scenarios or input domains. In this work, we
systematically generalize performance estimation to a diverse set of metrics
and scenarios and discuss generalized notions of uncertainty calibration. We
propose the use of post-hoc models to accomplish this goal and investigate
design parameters, including the model type, feature engineering, and
performance metric, to achieve the best estimation quality. Emphasis is given
to object detection problems and, unlike prior work, our approach enables the
estimation of per-image metrics such as recall and F1-score. Through extensive
experiments with computer vision models and datasets in three use cases --
mobile edge offloading, model selection, and dataset shift -- we find that
proposed post-hoc models consistently outperform the standard calibrated
confidence baselines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
develop a unified framework to address different performance estimation
problems for machine learning inference.","performance,scenarios,estimation",
Dirichlet polynomials and entropy,"A Dirichlet polynomial $d$ in one variable ${\mathcal{y}}$ is a function of
the form $d({\mathcal{y}})=a_n
n^{\mathcal{y}}+\cdots+a_22^{\mathcal{y}}+a_11^{\mathcal{y}}+a_00^{\mathcal{y}}$
for some $n,a_0,\ldots,a_n\in\mathbb{N}$. We will show how to think of a
Dirichlet polynomial as a set-theoretic bundle, and thus as an empirical
distribution. We can then consider the Shannon entropy $H(d)$ of the
corresponding probability distribution, and we define its length (or,
classically, its perplexity) by $L(d)=2^{H(d)}$. On the other hand, we will
define a rig homomorphism $h\colon\mathsf{Dir}\to\mathsf{Rect}$ from the rig of
Dirichlet polynomials to the so-called rectangle rig, whose underlying set is
$\mathbb{R}_{\geq0}\times\mathbb{R}_{\geq0}$ and whose additive structure
involves the weighted geometric mean; we write $h(d)=(A(d),W(d))$, and call the
two components area and width (respectively).
The main result of this paper is the following: the rectangle-area formula
$A(d)=L(d)W(d)$ holds for any Dirichlet polynomial $d$. In other words, the
entropy of an empirical distribution can be calculated entirely in terms of the
homomorphism $h$ applied to its corresponding Dirichlet polynomial. We also
show that similar results hold for the cross entropy.","mathcal,Dirichlet,mathbb",

"Neural-guided, Bidirectional Program Search for Abstraction and Reasoning","One of the challenges facing artificial intelligence research today is
designing systems capable of utilizing systematic reasoning to generalize to
new tasks. The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) measures such a
capability through a set of visual reasoning tasks. In this paper we report
incremental progress on ARC and lay the foundations for two approaches to
abstraction and reasoning not based in brute-force search. We first apply an
existing program synthesis system called DreamCoder to create symbolic
abstractions out of tasks solved so far, and show how it enables solving of
progressively more challenging ARC tasks. Second, we design a reasoning
algorithm motivated by the way humans approach ARC. Our algorithm constructs a
search graph and reasons over this graph structure to discover task solutions.
More specifically, we extend existing execution-guided program synthesis
approaches with deductive reasoning based on function inverse semantics to
enable a neural-guided bidirectional search algorithm. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the algorithm on three domains: ARC, 24-Game tasks, and a
'double-and-add' arithmetic puzzle.","ARC,reasoning,tasks",
"Deep machine learning potentials for multicomponent metallic melts: development, predictability and compositional transferability","The use of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) in simulations of
materials is a state-of-the-art approach, which allows achieving nearly
\textit{ab initio} accuracy with orders of magnitude less computational cost.
Multicomponent disordered systems have a highly complicated potential energy
surface due to both topological and compositional disorder. That arises issues
in MLIPs developing, such as optimal design strategy of potentials and their
predictability and transferability. Here we address MLIPs for multicomponent
metallic melts taking the ternary Al-Cu-Ni ones as a convenient example. We use
many-body deep machine learning potentials as implemented in the DeePMD-kit to
build MLIP that allows describing both atomic structure and dynamics of the
system in the whole composition range. Doing that we consider different sets of
neural networks hyperparameters and learning schemes to create an optimal MLIP,
which allows archiving good accuracy in comparison with both \textit{ab initio}
and experimental data. We find that developed MLIP demonstrates good
compositional transferability, which extends far beyond compositional
fluctuations in the training configurations. The results obtained open up
prospects for simulating structural and dynamical properties of multicomponent
metallic alloys with MLIPs.","MLIPs,approach,potentials",
Digital Product Management: Modern Fundamentals,"Not so long ago, the job of product manager was about assessing market data, creating requirements, and managing the hand-off to sales/marketing. Maybe you�d talk to a customer somewhere in there and they�d tell you what features they wanted. But companies that manage product that way are dying. Being a product person today is a new game, and product managers are at the center of it. Today, particularly if your product is mostly digital, you might update it several times a day. Massive troves of data are available for making decisions and, at the same time, deep insights into customer motivation and experience are more important than ever. The job of the modern product manager is to charter a direction and create a successful working environment for all the actors involved in product success. It�s not a simple job or an easy job, but it is a meaningful job where you�ll be learning all the time. This course will help you along your learning journey and prepare you with the skills and perspective you need to: Create the actionable focus to successfully manage your product (week 1) Focus your work using modern product management methods (week 2) Manage new products and explore new product ideas (week 3) Manage and amplify existing products (week 4) This course is ideal for current product or general managers interested in today's modern product management methods.

EMVLight: A Decentralized Reinforcement Learning Framework for Efficient Passage of Emergency Vehicles,"Emergency vehicles (EMVs) play a crucial role in responding to time-critical
events such as medical emergencies and fire outbreaks in an urban area. The
less time EMVs spend traveling through the traffic, the more likely it would
help save people's lives and reduce property loss. To reduce the travel time of
EMVs, prior work has used route optimization based on historical traffic-flow
data and traffic signal pre-emption based on the optimal route. However,
traffic signal pre-emption dynamically changes the traffic flow which, in turn,
modifies the optimal route of an EMV. In addition, traffic signal pre-emption
practices usually lead to significant disturbances in traffic flow and
subsequently increase the travel time for non-EMVs. In this paper, we propose
EMVLight, a decentralized reinforcement learning (RL) framework for
simultaneous dynamic routing and traffic signal control. EMVLight extends
Dijkstra's algorithm to efficiently update the optimal route for the EMVs in
real time as it travels through the traffic network. The decentralized RL
agents learn network-level cooperative traffic signal phase strategies that not
only reduce EMV travel time but also reduce the average travel time of non-EMVs
in the network. This benefit has been demonstrated through comprehensive
experiments with synthetic and real-world maps. These experiments show that
EMVLight outperforms benchmark transportation engineering techniques and
existing RL-based signal control methods.","traffic,signal,time",
Data-Efficient Graph Embedding Learning for PCB Component Detection,"This paper presents a challenging computer vision task, namely the detection
of generic components on a PCB, and a novel set of deep-learning methods that
are able to jointly leverage the appearance of individual components and the
propagation of information across the structure of the board to accurately
detect and identify various types of components on a PCB. Due to the expense of
manual data labeling, a highly unbalanced distribution of component types, and
significant domain shift across boards, most earlier attempts based on
traditional image processing techniques fail to generalize well to PCB images
with various quality, lighting conditions, etc. Newer object detection
pipelines such as Faster R-CNN, on the other hand, require a large amount of
labeled data, do not deal with domain shift, and do not leverage structure. To
address these issues, we propose a three stage pipeline in which a
class-agnostic region proposal network is followed by a low-shot similarity
prediction classifier. In order to exploit the data dependency within a PCB, we
design a novel Graph Network block to refine the component features conditioned
on each PCB. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the earliest attempts
to train a deep learning based model for such tasks, and we demonstrate
improvements over recent graph networks for this task. We also provide in-depth
analysis and discussion for this challenging task, pointing to future research.","PCB,components,task",

"Philosophy, Science and Religion: Religion and Science","Philosophy, Science and Religion mark three of the most fundamental modes of thinking about the world and our place in it. Are these modes incompatible? Put another way: is the intellectually responsible thing to do to �pick sides� and identify with one of these approaches at the exclusion of others? Or, are they complementary or mutually supportive? As is typical of questions of such magnitude, the devil is in the details. For example, it is important to work out what is really distinctive about each of these ways of inquiring about the world. In order to gain some clarity here, we�ll be investigating what some of the current leading thinkers in philosophy, science and religion are actually doing. This course, entitled �Religion and Science�, is the third of three related courses in our Philosophy, Science and Religion Online series. The course will address five themes, each presented by an expert in the area. 1. Science, Religion, and the Origin of the Universe (Professor Tim Maudlin, NYU ) 2. Buddhism and Science (Professor Graham Priest, CUNY) 3. Evolution and Design (Dr Kevin Scharp, St Andrews) 4. Sin Suffering and Salvation: Evolutions Thorny Issues (Dr Bethany Sollereder, Oxford) 5.

A theoretical look at ordinal classification methods based on reference sets composed of characteristic actions,"From a theoretical view, this paper addresses the general problem of
designing ordinal classification methods based on comparing actions with subset
of actions, which are representative of their classes (categories). The basic
demand of the proposal consists in setting a relational system (D, S), where S
is a reflexive relation compatible with the preferential order of the set of
classes, and D is a transitive relation such that D is a subset of S. Different
ordinal classification methods can be derived from diverse model of preferences
fulfilling the basic conditions on S and D. Two complementary assignment
procedures compose each method, which correspond through the transposition
operation and should be used complementarily. The methods work under relatively
slight conditions on the representative actions and satisfy several fundamental
properties. ELECTRE TRI-nC, INTERCLASS-nC, and the hierarchical ELECTRE TRI-nC
with interacting criteria, can be considered as particular cases of this
general framework.","classes,subset,categories",
Theoretical and practical aspects of the design and production of synthetic holograms for transmission electron microscopy,"Beam shaping - the ability to engineer the phase and the amplitude of massive
and massless particles - has long interested scientists working on
communication, imaging and the foundations of quantum mechanics. In light
optics, the shaping of electromagnetic waves (photons) can be achieved using
techniques that include, but are not limited to, direct manipulation of the
beam source (as in X-ray Free Electron Lasers (XFELs) and Synchrotrons),
deformable mirrors, spatial light modulators, mode converters and holograms.
The recent introduction of holographic masks for electrons provides new
possibilities for electron beam shaping. Their fabrication has been made
possible by advances in micrometric and nanometric device production using
lithography and focused ion beam patterning. This article provides a tutorial
on the generation, production and analysis of synthetic holograms for
transmission electron microscopy. It begins with an introduction to synthetic
holograms, outlining why they are useful for beam shaping to study material
properties. It then focuses on the fabrication of the required devices from
theoretical and experimental perspectives, with examples taken from both
simulations and experimental results. Applications of synthetic electron
holograms as aberration correctors, electron vortex generators and spatial mode
sorters are then presented.","Beam,Electron,shaping",

Optimistic Proximal Policy Optimization,"Reinforcement Learning, a machine learning framework for training an

domains. However, it is known that learning a good policy is difficult in a
domain where rewards are rare. We propose a method, optimistic proximal policy

uncertainty of the estimated total return and optimistically evaluates the
policy based on that amount. We show that OPPO outperforms the existing methods
in a tabular task.","Learning,OPPO,Reinforcement",
LeafMask: Towards Greater Accuracy on Leaf Segmentation,"Leaf segmentation is the most direct and effective way for high-throughput
plant phenotype data analysis and quantitative researches of complex traits.
Currently, the primary goal of plant phenotyping is to raise the accuracy of
the autonomous phenotypic measurement. In this work, we present the LeafMask
neural network, a new end-to-end model to delineate each leaf region and count
the number of leaves, with two main components: 1) the mask assembly module
merging position-sensitive bases of each predicted box after non-maximum
suppression (NMS) and corresponding coefficients to generate original masks; 2)
the mask refining module elaborating leaf boundaries from the mask assembly
module by the point selection strategy and predictor. In addition, we also
design a novel and flexible multi-scale attention module for the dual
attention-guided mask (DAG-Mask) branch to effectively enhance information
expression and produce more accurate bases. Our main contribution is to
generate the final improved masks by combining the mask assembly module with
the mask refining module under the anchor-free instance segmentation paradigm.
We validate our LeafMask through extensive experiments on Leaf Segmentation
Challenge (LSC) dataset. Our proposed model achieves the 90.09% BestDice score

the proximal operator calculating. Here we propose to employ a dual approach

method. Our recovering method not only reconstructs high-quality layers without
color-bias problem, but also theoretically guarantees good convergence
performance.","layers,recovering,superimposition",
